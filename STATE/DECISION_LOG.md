# DECISION LOG - Synapse

- 2026-05-31: Established active objective from operator request: complete and resolve all open GitHub issues in `chrisroyse/synapse`.
- 2026-05-31: Queue read found four open issues: #590, #589, #588, #585.
- 2026-05-31: Chose to continue #589 first because the worktree already contains partial hardware-HID removal progress matching the issue comment.
- 2026-05-31: Reconciled post-compaction state: hardware-HID removal is already in local commit `e0e9993`; remaining #589 work is stale systemspec docs plus manual runtime/client-parity FSV.
- 2026-05-31: Cleaned systemspec and PRD/impplan stale live hardware-HID references. Decided #589 FSV must launch a repo-built runtime because existing `synapse-mcp` processes are installed binaries and not proof of the local commit.
- 2026-05-31: Fixed signed profile package manifest test expectation after hardware-metadata removal changed the deterministic signature payload digest.
- 2026-05-31: Completed #589 manual FSV through the repo-built HTTP daemon using official MCP Inspector CLI for strict tools/list/client-parity and real `tools/call`; `CF_ACTION_LOG` deltas proved software happy path and fail-closed hardware/error edges.
- 2026-05-31: Posted #589 RESOLVED evidence comment, closed #589, pushed `828eec2` with `[skip ci]`, and moved active work to #590.
- 2026-05-31: Implemented #590 software-only input fidelity benches for SendInput click and ViGEm pad report timing. Manual FSV used the repo-built MCP daemon, Inspector strict `tools/list`, real `act_press`/`act_click`/`act_pad`/`release_all` tool calls, OS key/button state, XInput state, ViGEm PnP state, and `CF_ACTION_LOG` readbacks. Supporting checks and benches passed locally; commit/comment/close are next.
- 2026-05-31: Pushed #590 commit `e7e5b25`, posted RESOLVED evidence, and closed #590. Then closed #588 as resolved because its concrete follow-ups #589 and #590 are both closed with evidence. Remaining open queue is #585.
- 2026-05-31: Implemented #585 as a long-lived worker-owned UIA MTA thread and migrated runtime call sites to data-returning APIs. Direct Windows `UIElement` APIs now fail closed. Supporting checks and docs pass; manual repo-built MCP daemon FSV is pending.
- 2026-05-31: Completed #585 manual FSV through repo-built `synapse-mcp` PID `43940` on `127.0.0.1:7795` using official MCP Inspector. Happy path and depth0/depth999/invalid-param/concurrent observe edges passed with storage/log/process/UI SoT readbacks. Need amend the pushed commit message to add `[skip ci]`.
- 2026-05-31: Amended/pushed #585 as `0814a41` with `[skip ci]`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #585, and verified the live open issue queue returned no rows.
- 2026-05-31: After compaction, re-read required doctrine/state/issues and found the prior all-clear state stale. Live queue now has the #594 whole-body stress campaign plus #595-#635 open. Chose #635 first because it directly stress-tests daemon crash recovery and the UIA MTA concurrency behavior shipped for #585.
- 2026-05-31: Implemented #635 crash-recovery ledger/startup replay for held action inputs. Happy-path manual FSV proved a real Inspector `act_press` crash leaves Shift held and restart with the stable configured ledger path releases it; continuing combo/storage/concurrency/restart edges.
- 2026-05-31: Completed #635 manual FSV happy path plus combo crash, storage-write crash, concurrent observe/find/profile/action/reflex calls, invalid empty-key params, and rapid restart loop. Evidence is in `.runs\635\http-fsv-20260531T1106`; supporting checks/diff/commit remain before closing the issue.
- 2026-05-31: Reran #635 supporting checks after FSV and reviewed the diff; ready to commit/push with `[skip ci]` and close #635 with evidence.
- 2026-05-31: Reconciled wake state after compaction: #635 is closed at commit `632a834`; live queue is #594 plus #595-#634. Claimed #605 next because it exercises the same action safety surfaces as #635. Stopped leaked older stdio `synapse-mcp` processes while preserving active PID `45712` so an isolated #605 daemon can arm the operator hotkey.
- 2026-05-31: #605 first runtime pass found a real state-reset bug: release_all released mouse/pad physically, but the crash-recovery ledger still had unmatched button holds. Patched software release_all ledger clearing and added hold_move safety-cap grace so stuck-key auto-release wins the 30s boundary race.
- 2026-05-31: #605 second runtime pass found active hold-button reflexes could reassert mouse buttons after release_all. Patched release_all to quiesce initialized reflexes before draining action state and patched operator disable to stop the scheduler after disabling active reflexes.
- 2026-05-31: #605 release-daemon manual FSV now covers empty release_all, active key release_all, active mouse/pad release_all, stuck-key auto-release, operator hotkey release, and invalid act_press params. Remaining #605 runtime edge is debug-only panic-hook recovery.
- 2026-05-31: #605 debug panic-hook FSV passed on a repo-built debug daemon: forced `act_press` panic after keydown timed out at the client, but panic-hook release_all released Shift, removed the ledger, kept the daemon alive, and logged `reason="panic"` with result ok.
- 2026-05-31: #605 final supporting checks and diff review passed; ready to commit/push with `[skip ci]` and close the issue with manual FSV evidence.
- 2026-05-31: Pushed #605 commit `e0ea7e1`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #605, refreshed the open queue, and selected #606 `act_run_shell` orchestration next.
- 2026-05-31: Patched #606 so `act_run_shell` emits start/result action audit rows, enforces a 600000 ms timeout max, records idempotency rows in `CF_KV`, replays exact idempotent retries, and rejects conflicting idempotency-key reuse.
- 2026-05-31: Completed #606 manual FSV with repo-built daemons and official MCP Inspector: permissive/restrictive shell modes, env containment, default/max timeout, output cap, timeout, denied policy, idempotency replay/conflict, malformed regex startup, empty command, and above-max timeout rejection.
- 2026-05-31: #606 final supporting checks and diff review passed after two clippy cleanups; ready to commit/push with `[skip ci]` and close the issue with evidence.
- 2026-05-31: Pushed #606 commit `6975d14`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #606, refreshed the open queue, and selected #607 `act_launch` fleet/foregrounding next.
- 2026-05-31: Resumed #607 after compaction, confirmed the worktree patch targets the missing `CF_PROCESS_HISTORY` rows, and chose the on-disk profile files plus `profile_list` as the fleet-count SoT after both readbacks showed 29 profiles while #607 text says 30.
- 2026-05-31: #607 console runtime FSV exposed three launch hardening gaps: console targets needed `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`, action audit needed fast foreground metadata instead of a UIA subtree snapshot, and Windows foreground-lock needed an input nudge before retrying `SetForegroundWindow`.
- 2026-05-31: Replaced the unstable `CommandExt::show_window` console-launch patch with a direct Win32 `CreateProcessW` path using explicit `STARTUPINFOW`, because repo release builds must use stable Rust and Windows-native process creation is the documented surface for console show state.
- 2026-05-31: Tightened #607 existing-window matching after Chrome proved same-process single-instance reuse and Explorer proved title-only fallback could match an unrelated window; fallback now requires process-compatible identity.
- 2026-05-31: #607 Slack launch failed before spawn because action supported-use preflight used a depth-1 UIA snapshot and hit an Acrobat child with `RuntimeId=VT_EMPTY`; changed action/reflex scope preflight to use fast foreground identity and hardened UIA snapshot walking to warn/truncate bad child RuntimeIds instead of aborting the whole observation.
- 2026-05-31: #607 final8 manual FSV accepted 26 locally launchable profiles plus required console and edge cases through a repo-built daemon; documented host gaps for IE redirect, WordPad removal, and Minecraft Java sign-in/license runtime boundary, and added WordPad/IE profile metadata to prevent future false claims on modern Windows.
- 2026-05-31: #607 final supporting checks passed after clippy cleanups; repo-built release binary rebuilt successfully. Ready to commit/push with `[skip ci]`, post RESOLVED evidence, and close #607.
- 2026-05-31: Pushed #607 commit `8ce49e4`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #607, refreshed the open queue, and selected #608 `32-reflex saturation` as the next active P1 stress issue.
- 2026-05-31: #608 code inspection found exclusive was stored/audited but not used for arbitration, duplicate active reflex definitions were allowed through MCP/runtime, duplicate scheduler IDs were not rejected by validation, and health did not expose the 4096 scheduler sample-ring count needed for manual SoT readback. Patched those gaps while preserving exact-resource priority semantics.
- 2026-05-31: #608 real MCP aim-starvation run exposed that stateful controllers bypassed the conflict resolver, so two exclusive `aim_track` reflexes both fired. Patched stateful conflict planning before dispatch and changed starvation accounting to record losses once per tick.
- 2026-05-31: Completed #608 final manual FSV across repo-built isolated daemons for cap/duplicate/invalid edges, stateful priority+exclusive starvation and cancel recovery, and same-tick 32-dispatch/sample-ring behavior. Same-tick cleanup neutralized 3 pads and closed PID 70124/port 7825.
- 2026-05-31: Pushed #608 commit `5873c37`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #608, refreshed the open queue, and selected #609 `1ms reflex tick jitter under system load` as the next active P1 stress issue.
- 2026-05-31: #609 code inspection found `REFLEX_TICK_LATE` was only an in-process event/log line, not a `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT` row, so `reflex_history` could not serve as the issue's SoT. Patched tick-late audit persistence and health retained-sample counters.
- 2026-05-31: Completed #609 manual FSV with repo-built isolated daemons for idle 1ms baseline, real MCP `act_run_shell` CPU load, 16 concurrent subscribers, invalid/boundary parameter edges, and forced 2ms degraded fallback. Decided the persisted scheduler audit row plus health retained-sample counters are the acceptance SoTs because they survive client return values and expose both late ticks and fallback engagement.
- 2026-05-31: Pushed #609 commit `b7ecd73`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #609, refreshed the open queue, and selected #610 `aim_track reflex - moving target + track-loss` as the next reflex stress issue.
- 2026-05-31: #610 code inspection found the controller could resolve dynamic targets, but the scheduler always passed empty entity/element slices and correction/loss outcomes were not persisted as `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT` verdict rows. Patched runtime target-source wiring, correction audit rows, and fail-closed track-loss expiry before manual FSV.
- 2026-05-31: #610 first real MCP happy-path FSV failed: registered Notepad child element target expired with `REFLEX_TRACK_LOST` because the live M1 target source sampled only depth 0 and saw the root window. Decided aim_track target source must match `observe` default shallow depth 2, and synthetic M1 fixtures must honor requested depth so this cannot be masked in tests.
- 2026-05-31: #610 second real MCP moving-target pass exposed stale UIA root/child bounding boxes after Win32 window movement while foreground bounds were current. Decided Windows M1 input should rebase UIA element bboxes to the current foreground HWND position when root dimensions match, so `observe` and `aim_track` share physical moved-window coordinates.
- 2026-06-01: Completed #610 manual acceptance evidence with the repo-built isolated daemon and official MCP Inspector: moving target convergence, track loss, X-only/Y-only axes, deadzone no-op, max-speed clamp, target teleport, boundary priority, and empty/structurally-invalid fail-closed inputs all have separate cursor/observe/reflex/storage readbacks. Cleanup stopped PID 74696 and closed port 7831; final supporting checks are next.
- 2026-06-01: Pushed #610 commit `72581cb`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #610, refreshed the open queue, and selected #611 `on_event reflexes - HUD/audio/entity triggers + debounce` as the next reflex stress issue.
- 2026-06-01: #611 code inspection found debounce suppressions were silent, generic action/on_event `UntilEvent` lifetimes were not enforced or validated, and `reality_delta` bus events omitted redacted compact before/after values needed for HUD/audio/entity event filters. Patched those gaps before runtime FSV.
- 2026-06-01: #611 release build hit host memory pressure, so treated missing build headroom as D4 setup work. Shut down WSL after process SoT showed `vmmemWSL` holding the dominant pressure, then reran the canonical release build and read back the updated `synapse-mcp.exe` hash before manual FSV.
- 2026-06-01: Started #611 isolated runtime evidence on repo-built daemon PID `61628` at `127.0.0.1:7832`; official MCP Inspector strict `tools/list` succeeded with 80 tools. Chose a temporary WPF HUD target profile plus Luanti/entity path so the behavior FSV can use physical UI/audio/perception triggers and separate storage/UI readbacks.
- 2026-06-01: After compaction, reconciled #611 runtime state on active repo-built daemon PID `65300` at `127.0.0.1:7833`; strict Inspector tools/list still succeeds with 80 tools. Cancelled the stale 30s debounce reflex and determined its per-reflex history had only registered/fired/cancelled rows, so the large audit CF is scheduler tick-late volume rather than repeated debounce suppressions.
# 2026-06-01T02:25:39-05:00 - #611 observe_delta cursor read must start at next encoded row key

Decision: Fix `observe_delta` paging before continuing #611 acceptance evidence.

Evidence:
- During the #611 filter-never-match edge, the WPF UI SoT showed HP changed from `HP 10` to `HP 04` and ActionLog remained `READY `, but `observe_delta` returned only seq `21` while its `readback_rows` and head named a persisted seq `22`.
- A follow-up Inspector `observe_delta` from `since_seq=21` still returned no delta with head `22`, proving this was a cursor-read bug rather than just a missed first read.
- Code readback showed `read_delta_rows_after` scanned the first `max_deltas + 1` rows for the prefix and filtered `since_seq` afterward.

Outcome:
- Added start-key prefix scanning in `synapse-storage`, surfaced it through `synapse-reflex`, and made `observe_delta` scan from `delta_row_key(profile, epoch, since_seq + 1)`.
- Added regression `observe_delta_reads_after_cursor_past_first_page`.
- Supporting checks passed: focused MCP regression, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo check` for storage/reflex/mcp with `-j 2`.

# 2026-06-01T03:09:14-05:00 - #611 accept real event signals and use physical synthetic entity target for action SoT

Decision: Accept audio on the detector's actual transient event signal, and accept the entity action path on a physical Luanti-shaped WPF target after proving actual Luanti entity deltas.

Evidence:
- Audio WAV playback produced `audio_summary_changed`; the first RMS-only filter did not fire because the summary RMS was still at the floor after the synchronous playback. Retrying with a filter on `/after/latest_event_kind in [loud_transient, speech_started, music_started]` during async playback matched the actual transient: `150_audio_retry_delta_during_wav.json` read latest event `music_ended -> loud_transient`, RMS `-120000 -> -8726`, and `151` read ActionLog `READY AUDIO2_OK `.
- Actual Luanti launch `154/155` proved foreground `luanti.exe`, profile `luanti.minetest`, and two real entities (`luanti_crosshair_region`, `luanti_hotbar_region`). Direct software keyboard/chat attempts did not reach the Luanti log in this session.
- A physical WPF process copied as `luanti.exe` with a `Luanti 5.16.1 [Singleplayer]` title still exercised the same real foreground/capture/entity path and gave a target UI ActionLog SoT. `191_entity_final_delta.json` read entity_appeared deltas; `192` read ActionLog `ENTITY_READY ENTITY_FINAL_OK `; `193` read `reflex_fired` and `REFLEX_DEBOUNCED`.

Outcome:
- #611 behavior FSV coverage is captured for HUD, audio, entity, debounce, never-match, 8-deep boundary, UntilEvent expiry, empty params, boundary priority, and structurally invalid filter.
- Cleanup cancelled all active reflexes, ran `release_all`, stopped FSV-owned target/daemon processes, and left port `7834` without a LISTEN row.

# 2026-06-01T03:29:27-05:00 - #611 final local gates passed after compaction

Decision: Treat #611 as ready for commit and issue closure once the evidence comment is posted.

Evidence:
- Wake-up context, live #611/#594/#351 issues, open queue, git state, and configured wired `mcp__synapse` tool surface were re-read after compaction.
- The final code diff was reviewed and remains scoped to on_event debounce audit rows/events, generic `UntilEvent` expiry/validation, reality_delta event payloads and cursor paging, and storage prefix-scan support.
- Supporting checks passed on the current tree: fmt, storage/reflex/mcp checks, full reflex scheduler behavior, MCP schema sanitize, two focused reality tests, core error-code literal/snapshot tests, release build, and diff check.
- Release binary readback after the final build is `target\release\synapse-mcp.exe` SHA256 `1D291BB8B00A80377F450E2C285250F1045CC6A663B88F5BAD9990A8F434B7A1`, length `46325760`, timestamp `2026-06-01T08:28:59Z`.

Outcome:
- Next actions are commit/push `[skip ci]`, post #611 RESOLVED evidence, close #611, and refresh the live queue.

- 2026-06-01: Pushed #611 commit `5723393`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #611, refreshed the open queue, and selected #612 `hold_move / hold_button / combo reflex lifetimes` as the next active reflex stress issue.
- 2026-06-01: #612 code inspection found `hold_move.re_assert` was only schema/docs state and `reflex_cancel` did not release active hold inputs. Patched reassert keydown dispatch and cancel-time hold release action queuing before runtime FSV.
- 2026-06-01: #612 MCP `reflex_register` supporting test timeout root cause was non-aim reflex ticks sampling the aim-track M1 target source before checking controller presence. Patched `step_aim_track` to return before cursor/M1 reads for non-aim slots and added a regression proving `on_event` ticks do not call the aim target source.

# 2026-06-01T04:39:15-05:00 - #612 reassert must not grow crash-recovery ledger per tick

Decision: Keep physical reassert KeyDown dispatch, but suppress duplicate logical crash-recovery ledger writes.

Evidence:
- Real isolated #612 manual evidence on daemon PID `47904` showed `hold_move re_assert=true` correctly kept W physically down after an external KeyUp, proving the reassert behavior itself was needed.
- The separate recovery-ledger SoT read showed many duplicate `key_held` rows for W in `action_recovery.jsonl`, so long-running reassert would create unbounded crash-recovery file growth even though the logical held-input state had not changed.

Outcome:
- `append_recovery_event_at` now replays the current logical ledger and skips appending an event when it would leave recovered state unchanged and the existing file has no ignored trailing bytes.
- Added `recovery_log_skips_duplicate_logical_holds`.
- Supporting checks passed: `cargo fmt`, focused `synapse-action` recovery test, `cargo check -p synapse-action -j 2`, and `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.

# 2026-06-01T04:51:40-05:00 - #612 reassert dispatch must be periodic, not per-tick

Decision: Rate-limit `hold_move.re_assert` dispatch to a fixed 50 ms interval.

Evidence:
- Fresh real MCP evidence after the duplicate-ledger fix showed W stayed physically down and the recovery ledger stayed bounded at one row, but `reflex_cancel` returned `cancelled=true` while the after-read still showed W down and the ledger present.
- A delayed after-read still showed W down. `release_all` then released one key and removed the ledger, proving the backend could release W and the cancel problem was caused by queued reassert KeyDowns.
- Code readback showed the scheduler dispatched a reassert KeyDown every 1 ms tick while the hold was active.

Outcome:
- `HoldMoveController` now suppresses reassert until 50 ms have elapsed since the initial hold or last reassert.
- Focused regression updated to prove a 1 ms tick is only `Holding` with no queued action, while the next interval tick emits `Reasserted`.
- Supporting checks passed: `cargo fmt`, focused hold_move reassert test, focused recovery-ledger test, `cargo check` for `synapse-reflex` and `synapse-action`, and release build.

# 2026-06-01T05:33:52-05:00 - #612 cancel expired reflexes from persisted terminal audit state

Decision: Make `reflex_cancel` use the same persisted terminal status surface as `reflex_list include_expired=true` before returning `NotFound`.

Evidence:
- Manual #612 edge evidence showed `reflex_cancel` returned `cancelled=false, reason=not_found` for a one-shot combo while `reflex_list include_expired=true` still reported that same reflex as `expired`.
- Code readback showed `cancel` checked only `self.statuses()` from the live scheduler, while listing merges terminal statuses from `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT`.
- A scheduler can drop an already-expired reflex from the live active set while the persisted audit rows remain the user-visible terminal state.

Outcome:
- Added `terminal_status_from_audit(reflex_id)` and used it in `ReflexRuntime::cancel` when the live scheduler snapshot has no status.
- Expired/action-denied historical statuses now return `AlreadyExpired`; historical cancelled statuses retain the existing cancelled outcome.
- Added supporting regression `cancel_expired_reflex_restored_from_audit_reports_already_expired`.
- Fresh repo-built manual MCP rerun under `.runs\612\hold-lifetime-fsv-20260601T0530-cancel-expired` proved the edge: expired combo `019e82be-1a45-7d00-a817-22a9d7248818`, real Inspector `reflex_cancel`, response `already_expired`, OS P false before/after, recovery ledger absent, `reflex_history` lifecycle rows intact, `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT=2`.

- 2026-06-01: Pushed #612 commit `db761fe`, posted RESOLVED evidence, closed #612, refreshed the open queue, and selected #613 `subscribe firehose - 4096 ring, EVENTS_DROPPED, one-per-event, deep filters` as the next event-stream stress issue.

# 2026-06-01T07:09:36-05:00 - #613 harden SSE subscribe firehose behavior

Decision: Treat the #613 runtime findings as real defects and patch the event stream path before closure.

Evidence:
- Code readback showed `EventFilter::Data` validation did not validate JSON Pointer paths or regex patterns, so invalid filters could be accepted and then silently match false.
- Manual SSE readback on a fresh subscription with `Last-Event-ID: 0` exposed that `/events?subscription_id=<id>` created a new All subscription if the requested subscription's ring was still empty.
- Firehose stress needed drop accounting at the SSE ring layer as well as the event-bus queue layer; otherwise ring evictions were visible in stats but did not update the configured dropped-event metric surface.

Outcome:
- Added fail-closed data-filter validation for invalid paths and regex.
- Changed SSE reconnect to reuse an explicitly requested empty subscription when `Last-Event-ID: 0`.
- Added ring-overflow metric/drop accounting for per-subscription SSE ring eviction.
- Manual patched FSV under `.runs\613\subscribe-firehose-fsv-20260601T062230-patched` proved one-per-event delivery, 8-deep filters, 5000-event firehose drops, invalid edges, empty filter All, cancel behavior, cleanup, and strict Inspector tools-list.
- Supporting checks and final release build passed; next action is commit and close #613.

# 2026-06-01T07:16:00-05:00 - #614 reality-delta full-loop work starts after #613 closure

Decision: Take #614 next in the #594 stress campaign and inspect the reality baseline/delta/audit code before changing behavior.

Evidence:
- Live GitHub readback after compaction shows #613 closed and #614 open with no previous comments.
- #614 requires real MCP `reality_baseline`, `observe_delta`, and `reality_audit` triggers plus separate CF_KV/SSE/physical SoT reads for baseline, head, delta, audit, and sensor state.
- Posted #614 START comment at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/614#issuecomment-4592477025.
- Wired `mcp__synapse` client readback succeeded for `health`, `storage_inspect`, `reflex_list`, `reflex_history`, and `observe`.

Outcome:
- Next action is implementation/test inspection for reality baseline/delta/audit, followed by a repo-built isolated daemon and manual MCP FSV.

# 2026-06-01T07:36:00-05:00 - #614 fail closed and reuse the observed-profile baseline

Decision: Patch reality-tool server semantics before runtime FSV so omitted-profile baselines reuse the active profile head and invalid cursor/snapshot params fail closed.

Evidence:
- Code readback showed `reality_baseline` used `UNPROFILED_PROFILE_KEY` for the pre-observe reuse check when `profile_id` was omitted. That misses an existing `reality/head/v1/<observed-profile>` row and can create a new epoch for the active profile.
- Code readback showed `observe_delta.since_epoch` was not passed through `validate_key_segment` before comparison.
- Code readback showed `capture_reality_observation` clamped `depth`/`max_elements`, so a schema-bypassing caller could get accepted behavior for invalid params.

Outcome:
- Added an observed-profile reuse path for omitted-profile `reality_baseline`.
- Added `since_epoch` validation and server-side `depth`/`max_elements` bounds checks.
- Added focused regressions for baseline reuse, malformed epoch rejection, and out-of-range snapshot params; all focused checks passed.

# 2026-06-01T07:40:09-05:00 - #614 profile-change must be rebase guidance

Decision: Treat a known observed-profile switch during `observe_delta` as a rebase response, not a request parameter error.

Evidence:
- #614 explicitly requires a profile-change mid-walk edge.
- Code readback showed the stored head was selected from the requested `profile_id`, but the subsequent live observation used `select_profile(requested, observation)`, which rejects a known observed mismatch before the `profile_changed` response branch can run.
- The first narrow patch made the new edge pass, but the broader reality suite showed synthetic observations with no resolved profile were incorrectly treated as `unprofiled` switches.

Outcome:
- `observe_delta` now compares the stored requested head to the live observed profile only when the observation resolves a profile; unresolved observations retain the requested head profile.
- Added `observe_delta_reports_profile_changed_for_requested_head_mismatch`.
- Supporting checks passed: focused profile-change regression, all 14 reality tests, fmt check, `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`, schema sanitize tests, and release build.

# 2026-06-01T08:10:00-05:00 - #614 filesystem feed required an FS-watch subrun

Decision: Treat the missing `/fs` delta from the main #614 daemon as setup state, not acceptance failure, and prove the filesystem sensor with a second isolated repo-built daemon configured with `SYNAPSE_FS_WATCH_ROOT`.

Evidence:
- The main daemon was launched without `SYNAPSE_FS_WATCH_ROOT`, so `populate_fs_recent` had no watcher and the main `observe_delta` correctly produced foreground/focus/UIA/HUD/entity/audio/clipboard/diagnostics deltas but no `/fs` delta.
- Code readback showed the filesystem sensor is enabled only from the `SYNAPSE_FS_WATCH_ROOT` environment variable.
- D4 says a missing configured-host prerequisite is acquisition/setup work, not a blocker.

Outcome:
- Launched `.runs\614\fs-watch-fsv-20260601T0805` on `127.0.0.1:7841` with `SYNAPSE_FS_WATCH_ROOT` set to the run watch directory.
- Strict Inspector tools-list returned 80 tools; baseline/head rows were written; real MCP `act_run_shell` created a known file; separate file text/hash readback matched; `observe_delta` returned `/fs` `filesystem_summary_changed`; `storage_inspect` read CF_KV baseline/delta/head rows.

# 2026-06-01T08:19:00-05:00 - #615 follows #614 in the reality-delta campaign

Decision: Take #615 next after closing #614 because it is the next open reality-delta child under #594.

Evidence:
- Live queue after closing #614 lists #594 plus #595-#604 and #615-#634 open.
- #615 is open, has no prior comments, and requires high-fanout `observe_delta` coalescing and snapshot-budget evidence.
- Posted #615 START comment at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/615#issuecomment-4592942496.

Outcome:
- Next action is code/test inspection for UIA high-fanout coalescing and snapshot budget behavior before launching a repo-built isolated daemon for manual MCP FSV.

# 2026-06-01T09:28:31-05:00 - #615 threshold pressure must ignore incidental UIA metadata churn

Decision: Count only structural changes and material coalescing field changes toward the UIA high-fanout threshold; keep incidental focus and parent `children_count` changes out of threshold pressure while retaining full changed-id metadata on emitted aggregate deltas.

Evidence:
- The first manual Show7 boundary run physically created 7 item buttons, but `observe_delta` emitted `uia_structure_changed` because focus movement and parent `children_count` changes inflated `fanout_count` to the threshold.
- Code readback showed `uia_element_fanout` used all `changed_uia_element_ids`, so incidental UIA metadata could turn a low-fanout structural change into a high-fanout coalesced delta.
- #615 requires exact 7 vs 8 threshold behavior, low-fanout per-element rows, and high-fanout coalescing.

Outcome:
- Added `coalescing_uia_element_change_count` and `compact_element_has_coalescing_field_change`.
- Added supporting regressions for incidental changes below threshold, exact threshold coalescing, and mixed structure+field churn.
- Manual MCP FSV with repo-built daemon PID `64500` on `127.0.0.1:7843` proved Show7 per-element, Show8 coalesced, Rename8 coalesced, Mixed8 coalesced, Show80/Clear snapshot-budget rebase with no row growth, empty/no-change, invalid depth, and disappear8 behavior.
- Final checks and release build passed; next action is commit, RESOLVED comment, and close #615.

# 2026-06-01T09:31:17-05:00 - #616 follows #615 in the reality-delta campaign

Decision: Take #616 next after closing #615 because it is the next open reality-delta child under #594.

Evidence:
- `gh issue view 615` read back `state=CLOSED`, `closedAt=2026-06-01T14:30:47Z`.
- Live queue after #615 closure lists #594 plus #595-#604 and #616-#634 open.
- #616 is open, has no prior comments, and requires `reality_audit` drift injection and rebase evidence.
- Posted #616 START comment at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/616#issuecomment-4593554251.

Outcome:
- Next action is code/test inspection for `reality_audit`, followed by repo-built isolated daemon setup and manual MCP FSV.

# 2026-06-01T09:39:21-05:00 - #616 audit drift must be classified from changed fields, not hash inequality alone

Decision: Patch `reality_audit` to compute itemized physical drift from compact-state differences and apply a highest-severity-wins policy.

Evidence:
- Code readback showed `reality_audit` returned only `in_sync`, `rebase_required`, or `source_unavailable`; `minor_drift` and `major_drift` existed in the schema but were unreachable for physical drift.
- #616 requires no-drift, source-unavailable, minor-vs-major boundary, and rebase guidance.
- Exa lookup on drift-classification practice supported comparing concrete changed attributes and letting the maximum severity decide the verdict.

Outcome:
- Added audit drift analysis helpers, source-unavailable diagnostics detection, field-level severity classification, and focused regressions for in-sync, minor/major, source unavailable, and forced assumption mismatch.
- Focused `reality_audit_` test run passed; broader checks and manual MCP FSV are next.

# 2026-06-01T10:12:14-05:00 - #616 major drift should be a same-profile state divergence

Decision: Prove the major-drift boundary with an out-of-band UI-structure change inside a controlled `powershell` WinForms target, not by switching to a different foreground profile.

Evidence:
- `reality_audit` selects the profile from the freshly captured observation; a different-profile foreground switch would audit that profile's head or fail profile validation instead of testing the stored `powershell` head against changed physical state.
- The first attempt to launch a second PowerShell foreground was hosted by Windows Terminal, changing the observed profile surface and making it the wrong discriminator for #616.
- A same-profile WinForms target with a known new control directly exercises `uia_element_appeared`, which the patch classifies as `major_drift`.

Outcome:
- Temporary `.runs\616\issue616_major_target.ps1` was used only as FSV setup.
- Physical before/after readback showed child texts changed from `major-baseline-state|AddMajor|CloseTarget` to `major-baseline-state|AddMajor|CloseTarget|major-new-control`.
- Real Inspector `tools/call reality_audit` returned `drift_status=major_drift`, `rebase_required=true`, and persisted `reality/audit/v1/powershell/audit-01780326554678039600-0000000006`.

# 2026-06-01T10:21:23-05:00 - #617 follows #616 in the stress campaign

Decision: Take #617 next after closing #616 because it is the next open P1 storage child under #594.

Evidence:
- `gh issue view 616` read back `state=CLOSED`, `closedAt=2026-06-01T15:20:44Z`.
- Live queue after #616 closure lists #594 plus #595-#604 and #617-#634 open.
- #617 is open, has no prior comments, and requires storage CF saturation/GC eviction evidence.
- Posted #617 START comment at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/617#issuecomment-4593992720.

Outcome:
- Next action is code/test inspection for storage pressure, probe rows, and GC cap behavior before launching a repo-built isolated daemon for manual MCP FSV.

# 2026-06-01T10:53:00-05:00 - #618 follows #617 in the storage campaign

Decision: Take #618 next after closing #617 because it is the next open storage child under #594.

Evidence:
- `gh issue view 617` read back `state=CLOSED`, `closedAt=2026-06-01T15:52:11Z`.
- Live queue after #617 closure lists #594 plus #595-#604 and #618-#634 open.
- #618 is open, has no prior comments, and requires the storage pressure ladder/write-gating path.
- Posted #618 START comment at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/618#issuecomment-4594238857.

Outcome:
- Next action is code/test inspection for storage pressure levels, transition codes, compaction, and write-gating behavior before launching a repo-built isolated daemon for manual MCP FSV.

# 2026-06-01T11:18:00-05:00 - #618 diagnostic writes must expose pressure refusal explicitly

Decision: Route `storage_put_probe_rows` through pressure policy before non-empty diagnostic writes and return explicit `STORAGE_WRITE_FAILED` when the current pressure level refuses the target CF.

Evidence:
- Code readback showed the storage layer's lower-level `put_batch` suppresses pressure-blocked writes and reports success, which would make the diagnostic MCP surface report only zero rows rather than an explicit refusal.
- #618 specifically requires write-gating proof for CFs outside the original diagnostic allowlist and requires a gated write attempt to return an explicit refusal.
- The original diagnostic probe allowlist covered only five CFs, so real MCP FSV could not attempt writes to `CF_OCR_CACHE`, `CF_TELEMETRY`, `CF_MODEL_CACHE`, `CF_PROCESS_HISTORY`, or `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT`.

Outcome:
- Added storage/reflex pressure-permission read APIs and expanded `storage_put_probe_rows` to all 11 CFs.
- Non-empty blocked diagnostic writes now return MCP error `STORAGE_WRITE_FAILED`; empty `rows=0` remains a no-op.
- Manual MCP FSV with repo-built daemon PID `56980` on `127.0.0.1:7846` proved the full Normal/L1/L2/L3/L4/recovery ladder, strict thresholds, compaction counts, L3/L4 write gating, explicit refusal errors, empty/no-op, invalid CF, and recovery write reopen.

# 2026-06-01T11:29:00-05:00 - #619 follows #618 in the storage campaign

Decision: Take #619 next after closing #618 because it is the next open storage child under #594.

Evidence:
- `gh issue view 618` read back `state=CLOSED`, `closedAt=2026-06-01T16:27:18Z`.
- Live queue after #618 closure lists #594 plus #595-#604 and #619-#634 open.
- #619 is open, has no prior comments, and requires storage GC under concurrent writes evidence.
- Posted #619 START comment at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/619#issuecomment-4594506099.

Outcome:
- Next action is code/test inspection for `storage_gc_once`, probe rows, audit retention, and row cap behavior before launching a repo-built isolated daemon for manual MCP FSV.

# 2026-06-01T11:45:17-05:00 - #619 storage GC needs no code patch so far

Decision: Treat #619 as a runtime-proof issue unless final checks expose a code defect.

Evidence:
- Code inspection found existing row-cap GC, probe-row writes, and audit-retention report persistence paths for the required behavior.
- Manual MCP FSV against repo-built daemon PID `69600` on `127.0.0.1:7847` proved concurrent writes, heavy in-flight write + GC, max-age retention, dedupe/run_id report persistence, at-soft boundary, empty CF, invalid params, and below-hard-cap oscillation with separate `storage_inspect` readbacks.
- The daemon log contains expected `MCP_TOOL_INVOCATION`, `STORAGE_CF_HARD_CAP_REACHED`, `STORAGE_CACHE_EVICTIONS_TOTAL_INCREMENTED`, and intentional invalid-param lines, with no unexpected error/panic/corruption lines.

Outcome:
- No product-code change is currently needed for #619.
- Next action is final supporting checks/release build, then #619 RESOLVED comment and closure if checks stay green.

# 2026-06-01T11:54:30-05:00 - #620 follows #619 in the profile campaign

Decision: Take #620 next after closing #619 because it is the next open H-profile child under #594.

Evidence:
- `gh issue view 619` read back `state=CLOSED`, `closedAt=2026-06-01T16:53:51Z`.
- Live queue after #619 closure lists #594 plus #595-#604 and #620-#634 open.
- #620 is open and requires profile activation/keymap/HUD/capture/mode evidence.
- Posted #620 START comment at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/620#issuecomment-4594697356 and labeled it `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.

Outcome:
- Next action is code/profile-definition inspection before launching a repo-built isolated daemon for manual MCP FSV.

# 2026-06-01T12:45:00-05:00 - #620 needs non-mutating M1 mode/capture readback

Decision: Patch `profile_activate` to apply full profile runtime config and expose M1 mode/capture in non-mutating health plus observation diagnostics.

Evidence:
- Code readback showed `profile_activate` only called `apply_backend_resolution_for_profile`; it did not update `M1State.perception_mode` or capture config.
- `observe` can legitimately re-resolve foreground profile state, so using `observe` alone after activating a profile whose app is not foreground can mutate/read a different foreground profile.
- #620 requires proof that activation applies keymap/HUD/capture/mode; mode/capture needed a separate physical readback surface.

Outcome:
- Worktree patch adds M1 `active_capture_config`, `observe.diagnostics.capture_config`, and `health.subsystems.perception`.
- `profile_activate` now applies backend + M1 mode/capture.
- Foreground profile resolution now applies mode/capture into the observation input for matching-profile `observe`.
- Supporting tests/checks passed; manual isolated MCP FSV remains next.

# 2026-06-01T13:04:31-05:00 - #620 HUD live-slot evidence has an explained foreground-control gap

Decision: Accept #620 with HUD specs proven from profile SoT and document the live HUD-slot gap, rather than widening #620 into a host cursor/focus repair issue.

Evidence:
- Profile SoTs (`profile_list` and bundled TOML) expose HUD fields for `everquest.live`, `luanti.minetest`, and `minecraft.java`.
- Live Luanti launched from the configured host and process/window title matched the Luanti profile.
- Foreground focus stayed on PowerShell despite Win32 foreground attempts, `Alt+Tab`, and launching from the foreground shell.
- Both isolated and wired MCP `act_click` failed closed with `ACTION_BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE` because `SetPhysicalCursorPos` returned access denied.
- #620 acceptance allows a documented explained gap, and action/capture focus/cursor behavior is covered by separate action/capture stress children.

Outcome:
- #620 evidence records the HUD spec SoT and foreground-control gap explicitly.
- No extra profile-runtime patch is needed for HUD specs; final checks/commit/issue closure are next.
