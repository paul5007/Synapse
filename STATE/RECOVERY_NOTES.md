  - RESOLVED evidence: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/601#issuecomment-4604000389.
  - Closure readback: `state=CLOSED`, `closedAt=2026-06-02T15:31:27Z`.
  - Worktree was clean after push: `## main...origin/main`.
- Active issue is #602 `scenario(stress): act_drag boundary + Paint drawing + Explorer drag-drop`.
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/602#issuecomment-4604006525.
  - GitHub labels/assignee updated with `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`, and `ChrisRoyse`.
- #602 acceptance target:
  - real MCP `tools/call act_drag` through strict client-parity `tools/list`;
  - separate SoT reads for Paint/image bytes, filesystem path movement, action/storage audit rows, OS key/button state, process/socket cleanup, and any observe/read_text evidence used;
  - happy path Paint curve drawing and Explorer/file movement;
  - 4096px boundary and >4096px fail-closed;

  2. Patch only if code or FSV exposes a real gap.
  3. Run supporting checks, build release `synapse-mcp`, launch isolated daemon, verify process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector tools-list, then run #602 manual FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T10:25:00-05:00
- Active issue #601 is implemented and manual MCP/SoT FSV is accepted; final checks/commit/closeout remain.
- Patch in worktree:
  - `crates/synapse-reflex/src/kinds/combo.rs`: `completion_audit_details()` records due/elapsed/jitter/action details.
  - `crates/synapse-reflex/src/scheduler_stateful.rs`, `scheduler_loop.rs`, and `scheduler.rs`: combo completion writes nested `details.combo_completion` in the persisted lifetime-expired audit row.
  - `crates/synapse-reflex/tests/combo_behavior.rs`: supporting persisted-completion assertions.
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/src/m4.rs`: supporting validation coverage for empty, >256, non-monotonic, and unsupported action steps.
- Accepted runtime evidence:
  - `.runs\601\combo-fsv-20260602T1010`: daemon PID `92280`, bind `127.0.0.1:7881`, release SHA256 `669191BA58F581763DB6B389979EF6545ADC458B6AAA9BDEF72DB516FCC51B6D`, strict Inspector `tools/list=80`, 256-step `a` file SoT, and `35_256_combo_reflex_summary.json` with `512/512` primitive dispatches.
  - `.runs\601\combo-fsv-20260602T1030-edges`: daemon PID `85268`, bind `127.0.0.1:7882`, auth health/strict tools-list readbacks, target PID `84500`, single-step `z`, precise 256-step `b` run, fail-closed edges, and cleanup.
  - Precise 256-step accepted summary: combo `019e88ea-a31d-7921-86eb-4665c3decfce`, file length 256/SHA256 `69783923010E99687C31035CF20F1394EA6BB6047396B2FAE9EA600F085C33EB`, `scheduled_actions=512`, `dispatched_actions=512`, `elapsed_ms=5105`, `max_jitter_ms=0`, zero `action queue full` log matches.
  - Edge summaries: `16b_structural_object_steps_after_readback.json`, `24_empty_steps_edge_summary.json`, `28_nonmonotonic_edge_summary.json`, `33_257_steps_edge_summary.json`, `37_nonpress_edge_summary.json`.
  - Cleanup summary: `48_cleanup_readback.json` shows release_all zero, physical key/button states all not down, target/daemon stopped, and port `7882` closed.
- Final supporting checks passed after runtime FSV:
  - `cargo fmt --check`;
  - `git diff --check` (line-ending warnings only);
  - `cargo test -p synapse-reflex --test combo_behavior -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp combo_ -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp schema_sanitize -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --test m4_tools_list -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --test m3_reflex_history_tool -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo check -p synapse-reflex -p synapse-mcp -j 2`;
  - `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.
- Final release build readback: length `46748160`, SHA256 `F7C089061FE2CF23B5FBEC9D7A12C55FD19A7C38117CEA637A7CA0B02F4919D5`, timestamp `2026-06-02T15:28:21Z`.
- Tracked diff token scan found zero matches for the issue-local bearer token, raw auth header text, or bearer-token env var name; diff review completed.
- Rejected/setup artifacts to avoid citing as accepted:
  - Notepad focus attempts in the first run did not write to the file and are rejected as physical-output evidence.
  - The first edge-run cleanup attempt `04_old_run_cleanup.json` used PowerShell's read-only `$PID` loop variable and did not stop anything; accepted cleanup is `04b_old_run_cleanup.json`.
  - `15_file_after_single_combo.json` is a structural-invalid `steps` object attempt, not the successful single-step combo. Successful single-step evidence is `18_file_after_single_combo.json` plus `20c_single_combo_reflex_summary_corrected.json`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Commit with `[skip ci]`.
  2. Push, post #601 RESOLVED evidence, close #601, remove stale labels.
  3. Refresh queue and claim #602 unless GitHub changed.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T09:45:00-05:00
- #600 is closed with commit `5cf6e0b` and RESOLVED evidence at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/600#issuecomment-4603513011.
- Worktree was clean after pushing #600: `## main...origin/main`.
- Active issue is #601 `scenario(stress): act_combo 256-step timed precision - play a song / macro`.
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/601#issuecomment-4603519772.
  - Labels/assignee updated with `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`, and `ChrisRoyse`.
- #601 acceptance target:
  - real MCP `tools/call act_combo` for strictly increasing timed sequences up to 256 steps;
  - separate SoT reads for action/reflex audit rows and physical target/audio output where practical;
  - timing/jitter comparison between requested and actual dispatch;
  - edges for non-monotonic steps, 257 steps, unsupported combo action, single-step combo, empty/structurally invalid params, and cleanup release state.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Inspect `act_combo` tool params, validation, scheduling/runtime path, and existing tests.
  2. Patch only if the real code path cannot satisfy #601.
  3. Run supporting checks, build release `synapse-mcp`, then launch an isolated daemon for manual MCP/SoT FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T10:05:00-05:00
- Active issue remains #601.
- Patch in progress:
  - `crates/synapse-reflex/src/kinds/combo.rs`: adds `completion_audit_details()` with per-dispatch due/elapsed/jitter/action details.
  - `crates/synapse-reflex/src/scheduler_stateful.rs` and `src/scheduler_loop.rs`: persisted combo completion audits now include `details.combo_completion` while preserving `REFLEX_LIFETIME_EXPIRED` completion rows.
  - `crates/synapse-reflex/tests/combo_behavior.rs`: asserts the persisted combo completion audit includes dispatch timing details.
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/src/m4.rs`: adds supporting validation tests for empty steps, >256 steps, non-monotonic steps, and unsupported combo actions.
- Focused checks passed:
  - `cargo fmt`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-reflex --test combo_behavior -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp combo_ -- --nocapture`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Run `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo check -p synapse-reflex -p synapse-mcp -j 2`, schema/tool-list tests, and any focused action/reflex tests needed.
  2. Build release `synapse-mcp`.
  3. Launch isolated repo-built daemon for #601, verify process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  4. Manual FSV: 256-step monotonic combo, timing/jitter storage readback, single-step combo, empty steps, non-monotonic, 257 steps, unsupported action, structurally invalid params, physical target output, storage/action log deltas, and cleanup `release_all`.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T09:40:00-05:00
- Active issue #600 has implementation, accepted manual MCP/SoT FSV, cleanup, final supporting checks, release build/readback, and diff review complete.
- Patch:
  - `crates/synapse-action/src/handle.rs`: normal `execute` fails closed with `ACTION_QUEUE_FULL`; emitter-backed handles include a safety lane; `ReleaseAll` requests the release interrupt before enqueue.
  - `crates/synapse-action/src/emitter.rs` and `src/emitter/lifecycle.rs`: actor owns/polls the safety lane before normal queue work and rejects pending normal actions after `ReleaseAll` with `SAFETY_RELEASE_ALL_FIRED`.
  - `crates/synapse-action/src/hotkey.rs` and `src/lib.rs`: expose `request_release_interrupt()`.
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/src/m2/release_all.rs`: MCP release_all advances the interrupt epoch before snapshot/readback.
  - Regression tests updated in `synapse-action` handle/emitter/rate-limit coverage and MCP release/press tests.
- Accepted FSV evidence directory: `.runs\600\action-flood-fsv-20260602T0904-final`.
  - Daemon PID `40028`, bind `127.0.0.1:7880`, release SHA256 `786FF6F6B62AC564F8F0C7A1DC20E8226A6720AB44A6EB6B75064EC8E88081C2`, strict Inspector `tools/list=80`.
  - Happy path Notepad file SoT after real `act_press` calls was exactly `def`, SHA256 `CB8379AC2098AA165029E3938A51DA0BCECFC008FD6795F401178647F96C5B34`; storage `CF_ACTION_LOG=10`.
  - Over-queue flood produced `ACTION_QUEUE_FULL=317` and `SAFETY_RELEASE_ALL_FIRED=256`; in-flight middle-button hold elapsed `1549 ms` instead of `30000 ms`; OS input after/final all false; storage grew to `CF_ACTION_LOG=1813`.
  - Empty, structurally invalid, exact 256, just-under 255, ViGEm happy, and Shift/KeyUp safety edges were accepted with before/after file, storage, OS-input, and process/log readbacks.
  - Documented rate-limit gap: strict real public MCP paths could not exceed the software/ViGEm token buckets on this host before queue/backend/RPC throughput dominated; supporting bucket tests prove exact bucket behavior.
  - Cleanup: release_all zero; daemon PID `40028` stopped and port closed; Notepad PID `60556` closed; file still `def`.
- Rejected/partial runs to avoid citing as final:
  - `.runs\600\action-flood-fsv-20260602T0804-patched` predates final release_all interrupt patch.
  - `.runs\600\action-flood-fsv-20260602T0904-final\edge_manual_20260602T091529` had malformed PowerShell header invocation.
  - `.runs\600\action-flood-fsv-20260602T0904-final\boundary_exact_256_20260602T092002` and `boundary_just_under_255_20260602T092016` failed setup due header/import splitting.
- Final supporting checks passed: fmt check, diff check, action handle/emitter/rate-limit tests, MCP release_all/act_press/schema/tool-list tests, touched-crate check, and release build.
- Final release build after cleanup: length `46730752`, SHA256 `8338D75A74663970FE2239119158082D3D03F8F156F7E9B05276813E10BEFEFB`, timestamp `2026-06-02T14:34:15.8470672Z`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Run tracked diff/token scan.
  2. Commit with `[skip ci]`, push.
  3. Post #600 RESOLVED evidence with the documented rate-limit gap, close #600, remove stale `status:in-progress`/`agent:codex`.
  4. Refresh queue and take #601 unless GitHub changed.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T07:55:36-05:00
- Active issue remains #600.
- Root-cause patch stack now includes:
  - normal MCP action enqueue via `ActionHandle::execute` fails closed with `ACTION_QUEUE_FULL` instead of awaiting bounded-channel capacity;
  - emitter-backed handles carry a priority safety lane for `ReleaseAll` and `KeyUp`;
  - the actor polls safety/auto-release/snapshot/shutdown before normal actions and rejects pending normal actions after `ReleaseAll` with `SAFETY_RELEASE_ALL_FIRED`;
  - MCP `ReleaseAll` now also calls `request_release_interrupt()` before enqueue so in-flight software holds that poll the release epoch stop early instead of delaying safety until the requested hold duration expires.
- Supporting checks passed after the interrupt patch:
  - `cargo fmt`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-action --test handle_queue -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-action --test emitter_state release_all_safety_lane_preempts_saturated_normal_queue -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo check -p synapse-action`.
- Existing #600 isolated daemon PID `75412` on `127.0.0.1:7879` is still alive but predates the interrupt patch; use it only for cleanup, then stop it and launch a fresh repo-built daemon.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Run broader `synapse-action`/`synapse-reflex`/`synapse-mcp` checks and release build.
  2. Call real Inspector `release_all` on old PID `75412`, stop it, and verify port `7879` closed.
  3. Launch a fresh isolated repo-built #600 daemon and repeat process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  4. Manual FSV: Notepad happy path, queue overflow with long `act_click` hold + concurrent click flood, interleaved release_all during that flood, software/ViGEm rate-limit evidence or documented strict-client throughput gap, refill recovery, empty/boundary/invalid params, storage/log/OS/file readbacks, and cleanup.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T07:30:35-05:00
- Active issue remains #600.
- Confirmed root cause:
  - real MCP action tools used `ActionHandle::execute`, whose old bounded `send().await` could wait for capacity rather than surfacing `ACTION_QUEUE_FULL`;
  - `ReleaseAll`/panic/operator safety release and `KeyUp` could be delayed by the same normal queue even though the rate limiter exempted them.
- Patch applied:
  - `crates/synapse-action/src/handle.rs`: normal `execute` now fails closed with `ACTION_QUEUE_FULL`; emitter-backed handles have an unbounded safety lane for `ReleaseAll`/`KeyUp`; panic/operator release uses that lane when available.
  - `crates/synapse-action/src/emitter.rs` and `src/emitter/lifecycle.rs`: emitter owns the safety receiver, biases safety/auto-release/snapshot/shutdown before normal actions, and rejects pending normal actions after `ReleaseAll` with `SAFETY_RELEASE_ALL_FIRED`.
  - `crates/synapse-action/tests/handle_queue.rs`: supporting regression for `execute` queue-full at 256.
  - `crates/synapse-action/tests/emitter_state.rs`: supporting regression that release_all preempts a saturated normal queue and queued keydowns do not dispatch afterward.
- Supporting checks passed so far:
  - `cargo fmt`
  - `cargo check -p synapse-action`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-action --test handle_queue -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-action --test emitter_state release_all_safety_lane_preempts_saturated_normal_queue -- --nocapture`
- Exact next actions:
  1. Run `cargo check -p synapse-reflex -p synapse-mcp -j 2` plus focused MCP action/schema/tool-list checks.
  2. Run final format/diff checks and release build.
  3. Launch a fresh isolated repo-built #600 daemon, verify process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  4. Manual FSV: Notepad happy path, exact capacity boundary, over-rate `ACTION_RATE_LIMITED`, recovery after refill, queue overflow `ACTION_QUEUE_FULL`, interleaved `release_all` during flood, KeyUp/release safety, ViGEm bucket if available, empty/invalid params, cleanup.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T07:20:00-05:00
- #599 is closed with commit `9252e93` and RESOLVED evidence at https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/599#issuecomment-4602291835.
- Worktree was clean after pushing #599: `## main...origin/main`.
- Active issue is #600 `scenario(stress): SendInput rate-limit + action-queue overflow`.
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/600#issuecomment-4602297629.
  - Labels/assignee updated with `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`, and `ChrisRoyse`.
- #600 acceptance target:
  - real MCP `tools/call` triggers for `act_press`/`act_click` flood, `release_all`, and any relevant pad path;
  - separate SoT reads for `CF_ACTION_LOG`, Notepad text, OS key/button state, process/socket/log bytes, and cleanup state;
  - happy/boundary/edge coverage for exactly-at-capacity burst, over-limit `ACTION_RATE_LIMITED`, recovery after refill, queue overflow `ACTION_QUEUE_FULL`, release safety exemption, ViGEm bucket if available, and empty/invalid params.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Inspect software action backend, token bucket, queue, and audit logging implementation.
  2. Decide whether code needs a patch before runtime FSV.
  3. Build/launch isolated repo-built daemon and run manual MCP/SoT FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T06:58:40-05:00
- Active issue #599 has implementation, manual MCP/SoT FSV, final supporting checks, and diff review complete; commit, push, RESOLVED comment, closeout, and queue refresh remain.
- Accepted run: `.runs\599\audio-fsv-20260602T0647-accepted`.
  - Daemon PID `76024`, bind `127.0.0.1:7877`, release SHA256 `A5B88B6B1048EB64AB9A7E8CEB77979D8FB4EF26112964F3DCB27F634DDBEC09`, strict Inspector `tools/list=80`.
  - Covered zero/100ms/silence, panning left/center/right, speech+tone, overlapping speech, loud transient, exact English transcription via 6s window, non-English fail-closed, invalid seconds, overmax seconds, 30s boundary, and metadata-only log/DB scans.
  - Accepted disabled-edge run: `.runs\599\audio-fsv-20260602T065621-disabled-final3`; daemon PID `44472` on `127.0.0.1:7878`, audio disabled health, `audio_tail` refused with `READ_AUDIO`, storage before/after zero.
  - Cleanup done: release_all zero on both daemons, PIDs stopped, ports `7877`/`7878` closed, no `ffplay`, Chrome/pulseaudio mutes restored to unmuted.
- Rejected evidence to remember:
  - `.runs\599\audio-fsv-20260602T0610` had Chrome/YouTube contamination;
  - center/right panning files `07_audio_tail_center_stdout.json` and `08_audio_tail_right_stdout.json` overlapped because they were launched in parallel; use `07b` and `08b`;
  - `12_audio_transcribe_hello_stdout.json` missed `Hello world`; use `12b_audio_transcribe_hello_6s_stdout.json`;
  - disabled-edge `final`/`final2` failed setup due wrong token env name; `final3` is accepted.
- Final supporting checks passed:
  - `cargo fmt --check`;
  - `git diff --check` with line-ending warnings only;
  - stale audio docs scan for old `f32`/`u32`/5s wording;
  - focused/full `synapse-audio`, `synapse-telemetry`, MCP audio, M3 audio snapshot/tool-list, schema-sanitize, touched-crate check, and release build.
- Final release build readback: length `46730240`, SHA256 `5DA77B06F1E100B2E4049B460E56240B782C6162157FDFCA7AEC89E0B8D6A04A`, timestamp `2026-06-02T12:13:43Z`; accepted FSV daemon binary SHA was `A5B88B6B1048EB64AB9A7E8CEB77979D8FB4EF26112964F3DCB27F634DDBEC09`.
- Diff review completed; tracked diff token scan found no actual bearer token values.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Commit with `[skip ci]`.
  2. Push, post #599 RESOLVED evidence, close issue, remove stale labels, refresh queue.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T05:49:18-05:00
- Active issue #599 is patched locally but not yet checked, built, manually FSV-verified, committed, or closed.
- Wake context/GitHub/git were re-read after compaction:
  - #351 decision still binds manual FSV only, no GitHub Actions/CI, commits `[skip ci]`;
  - #594 parent remains open;
  - #599 is the current in-progress child;
  - #624/#625 remain blocked;
  - `git status --short --branch` was clean before #599 edits.
- Root contract gaps found:
  - audio ring/tool cap was 5 seconds, conflicting with #599's `0.1..=30` stress window;
  - `audio_tail.seconds` / `audio_transcribe.seconds` were `u32`, blocking fractional 100 ms probes through strict clients;
  - `audio_tail` returned PCM only, while #599 requires direct RMS/VAD/event/azimuth verification on the audio tool surface.
- Local patch in progress:
  - `synapse-audio` default/max ring is 30 seconds;
  - M3 audio params use numeric `f32` seconds with finite `0..=30` validation;
  - `audio_tail` now returns PCM plus compact metadata (`requested_seconds`, `captured_seconds`, `frames`, `rms_db`, `vad_speech_pct`, recent events, optional direction);
  - zero-second `audio_tail` still returns empty PCM and zeroed metadata without initializing the runtime;
  - focused tests/docs are updated but checks have not yet run.
- Host model prerequisite readback already done:
  - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\synapse\models\whisper-tiny-int8.onnx` exists and SHA256 matches `147AFAC751F89AD8E8F82133464EDC81ECFF9391E98CCDCAE2474384BE68EC86`;
  - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\synapse\models\ort-extensions` exists.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Run `cargo fmt`.
  2. Run focused audio tests and schema/tool-list checks; update snapshots if the new schema is accepted.
  3. Build release `synapse-mcp`.
  4. Create `.runs\599\...`, copy/read model + extension SoTs into isolated `LOCALAPPDATA`, launch repo-built daemon with `--enable-audio`, verify process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  5. Perform manual #599 FSV: silence, 0.1s boundary, 30s boundary, panned stereo direction, music/transient, English speech transcription, non-English fail-closed edge, audio disabled, and structural invalid input, with separate physical SoT/log/storage readbacks.

- Superseded by the 05:36 final-check checkpoint above.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T05:12:31-05:00
- Active issue remains #598.
- Rejected first isolated run `.runs\598\detection-fsv-20260602T0458` as final acceptance evidence after it exposed two setup/product facts:
  - isolated `LOCALAPPDATA` needed the RT-DETR model copied into `.runs\598\...\localappdata\synapse\models\rtdetr_v2_s_coco.onnx`; hash readback matched the registry;
  - old `STALE_TRACK_MS=1500` pruned tracks between strict Inspector observations, causing moving cats to reacquire track IDs instead of producing velocity.
- Patch now applied:
  - `STALE_TRACK_MS=3000`;
  - systemspec docs updated accordingly.
- Checks after patch passed:
  - `cargo fmt --check`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp tracker_ -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.
- Current release binary:
  - `C:\code\Synapse\target\release\synapse-mcp.exe`;
  - length `46708736`;
  - SHA256 `F8B15ED79B3A5D4D1FF9CE2522189341614589D73348410C4F330A982E170264`;
  - `LastWriteTimeUtc=2026-06-02T10:12:23Z`.
- Target window PID `74240` is still live and can be reused or restarted; title `Issue598DetectionTarget`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Start fresh post-patch isolated daemon on a fresh port with fresh DB/log/appdata/localappdata.
  2. Copy verified RT-DETR model into that run's isolated `LOCALAPPDATA\synapse\models` and read SHA256 before observing.
  3. Verify process/socket/binary, unauth/auth health, strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  4. Rerun manual #598 FSV: pixel_only still, pixel_only moving track/velocity, hybrid mode, `find` by `cat`, leave/re-enter after >3000 ms, confidence floor, max cap, black frame, structural invalid.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T04:56:41-05:00
- Active issue remains #598.
- The #598 detection patch has passed supporting checks and release build.
- Current release binary:
  - `C:\code\Synapse\target\release\synapse-mcp.exe`;
  - length `46708736`;
  - SHA256 `696E42B2CA5B590A5605950BC47A37F5E656307F9D950D14B7AACA7E4501AE01`;
  - `LastWriteTimeUtc=2026-06-02T09:56:34Z`.
- Supporting checks passed after the latest edits:
  - `cargo fmt --check`;
  - focused tracker/class-filter/manual-mode tests;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-models --test model_loader -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo check -p synapse-models -p synapse-mcp -j 2`;
  - schema sanitize and `m4_tools_list`;
  - systemspec contradiction scans;
  - `git diff --check` with line-ending warnings only;
  - release build.
- Docs now reflect live detector invocation and `DetectionFrame.rgb`; no systemspec stale detector-only-synthetic claim remains.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Create `.runs\598\<run-id>` with isolated `db`, `logs`, `appdata`, `localappdata`, and token.
  2. Start `target\release\synapse-mcp.exe` in HTTP mode on the next free localhost port.
  3. Read process table, binary path/hash, socket listener, unauth `/health=401`, auth `/health ok=true`.
  4. Run strict MCP Inspector `tools/list`; required tools: `set_perception_mode`, `observe`, `find`, `storage_inspect`, `release_all`.
  5. Launch deterministic moving target and proceed with #598 manual MCP/SoT FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T04:46:11-05:00
- Active issue remains #598:
  - title `scenario(stress): detection + entity tracking on fast-moving scene (pixel_only/hybrid)`;
  - START comment https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/598#issuecomment-4600966276;
  - assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labels include `status:in-progress` and `agent:codex`.
- Wake-up after compaction was rerun and reconciled:
  - doctrine files, `STATE/*`, #351/#594/#598, live open queue, git status/log, and wired configured MCP health/storage/observe/find were read;
  - configured MCP is alive but still an old installed stdio daemon with `detection_status=disabled`; do not use it as acceptance for #598.
- Current #598 patch:
  - `synapse-models` now carries RGB frame bytes through `DetectionFrame` and decodes RT-DETR ONNX output into detections;
  - `synapse-mcp` now runs detection during `observe`/`find` for effective `pixel_only`/`hybrid`, defaults to the registered RT-DETR model, fails closed on capture/model/inference errors, and assigns tracked entities with stable `track_id` and `velocity_px_s`;
  - explicit `set_perception_mode pixel_only/hybrid` now survives profile runtime application; `auto` clears the manual override.
- Local prerequisite readbacks already done:
  - pinned RT-DETR model exists at `C:\Users\hotra\AppData\Local\synapse\models\rtdetr_v2_s_coco.onnx`;
  - SHA256 `583A236AC21C95A7FD94F284FC21485E42355BFEF82C27011BA78FBC09EE87E2`;
  - local ONNX Runtime probe successfully decoded the official COCO cats image.
- Supporting checks already passed:
  - `cargo fmt`;
  - `cargo check -p synapse-models -j 2`;
  - `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-models --test model_loader -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp tracker_ -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp runtime_apply -- --nocapture`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Update systemspec docs that still say detectors are not invoked.
  2. Run `cargo fmt --check`, schema sanitize, `m4_tools_list`, touched-crate checks/tests, and `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.
  3. Launch an isolated repo-built #598 HTTP daemon from the release binary on a fresh port with isolated DB/log/appdata/localappdata/token.
  4. Verify process table, binary path/hash, socket, unauth/auth `/health`, and strict MCP Inspector `tools/list` for `set_perception_mode`, `observe`, `find`, `storage_inspect`, and `release_all`.
  5. Create a deterministic moving visual target with real COCO-detectable objects; read target state file, process/window geometry, and frame/pixel SoTs before each trigger.
  6. Trigger real Inspector MCP calls for `pixel_only` and `hybrid` observations and `find`; separately read target state/screens/storage/logs after each trigger.
  7. Cover edges: leave/re-enter after tracker stale timeout, confidence threshold floor, max detections cap, black frame, empty/no-entity frame, and structurally invalid params.
  8. Cleanup with real `release_all`, stop target/daemon, verify port/processes absent, then commit/post/close #598 if accepted.

  - START comment https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/598#issuecomment-4600966276;
  - assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labels include `status:in-progress` and `agent:codex`.
- #598 intent:
  - prove real MCP `set_perception_mode`, `observe`, and `find` behavior for detection/entity tracking on a fast-moving scene;
  - cover `pixel_only` and `hybrid`, stable `track_id`, `velocity_px_s`, and entity `find`;
  - read separate physical SoTs from target/frame evidence, process/window state, isolated storage/logs, and observed entity output.
- Required #598 edges:
  - object leaves/re-enters frame;
  - confidence threshold floor;
  - max_detections cap;
  - black/empty frame;
  - structurally invalid params.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Inspect detection/entity tracking implementation, model/runtime dependency paths, and profile/perception mode wiring.
  2. If a model/runtime prerequisite is missing, acquire/configure it locally and read its physical SoT.
  3. Build/launch a repo-built isolated #598 daemon, verify process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  4. Create a deterministic moving visual target and run manual MCP/SoT FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T03:21:12-05:00
- Active issue #596 is ready for commit/RESOLVED posting.
- Patch:
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/src/m1.rs` validates re-resolved `element_window` UIA bounds are non-empty before accepting the owning HWND.
- Accepted manual FSV artifacts:
  - main run `.runs\596\capture-target-fsv-20260602T0310-hiddenfix`;
  - DXGI run `.runs\596\capture-target-fsv-20260602T0310-hiddenfix-dxgi`;
  - release SHA256 `DE9BEFF453DD5A1C45035A3F5836C6453DC1D5E824B6B2A06F9DCD9C286FAA22`.
- Main coverage:
  - repo-built daemon PID `47680`, bind `127.0.0.1:7867`, unauth/auth health, strict Inspector `tools/list=80`;
  - physical SoTs: DISPLAY2 `5120x2160`/150%, DISPLAY1/DISPLAY3 `2560x1440`, target DWM `1332x801`, target DPI 144, edge id/bbox;
  - primary min-floor, monitor0, window, visible element_window, and switch-to-monitor1 all passed through real Inspector `tools/call` triggers with separate health/observe readbacks;
  - invalid monitor, structural invalid, hidden element, and closed HWND all failed closed with state unchanged.
- DXGI coverage:
  - daemon PID `23940`, bind `127.0.0.1:7868`, `SYNAPSE_CAPTURE_FORCE_DXGI=1`, strict Inspector `tools/list=80`;
  - monitor0 produced DXGI `5120x2160`;
  - live window HWND under forced DXGI rejected with `DXGI duplication supports monitor targets only` and state unchanged.
- Cleanup:
  - release_all zero on both daemons;
  - stopped daemons and target, verified ports `7867`/`7868` closed and target absent.
- Supporting checks:
  - focused M1/capture/schema/tool-list checks, touched-crate check, release build;
  - final `cargo fmt --check` and `git diff --check` passed (line-ending warnings only).
- Exact next actions:
  1. Stage only `crates/synapse-mcp/src/m1.rs` and `STATE/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `STATE/DECISION_LOG.md`, `STATE/HEARTBEAT.md`, `STATE/RECOVERY_NOTES.md`.
  2. Commit `fix(mcp): reject empty element capture targets (#596) [skip ci]`.
  3. Push, post #596 RESOLVED evidence, close #596, remove stale `status:in-progress`, refresh queue, continue with next open unblocked issue.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T03:04:07-05:00
- Active issue remains #596.
- Current patch since the prior WGC stop-control fix:
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/src/m1.rs` now rejects `element_window` targets whose re-resolved UIA bounding rectangle has `w <= 0` or `h <= 0`;
  - this fixes the observed hidden/collapsed element edge where UIA still found the old element id but returned bbox `0x0`, and `set_capture_target` incorrectly switched to the owning HWND.
- Supporting checks passed after the hidden-element patch:
  - `cargo fmt`;
  - focused M1 helper regression, capture interval floor, inactive runtime readback;
  - capture DXGI-window reject, switch stop regression, and thread-priority regression;
  - touched-crate `cargo check`;
  - schema sanitize and `m4_tools_list`;
  - `cargo fmt --check`, `git diff --check` with line-ending warning only, and release build.
- Release binary ready for manual #596 FSV:
  - `target\release\synapse-mcp.exe`;
  - SHA256 `DE9BEFF453DD5A1C45035A3F5836C6453DC1D5E824B6B2A06F9DCD9C286FAA22`;
  - length `46603776`;
  - `LastWriteTimeUtc=2026-06-02T08:03:53Z`.
- Cleanup already done:
  - old isolated #596 daemon PID `43768` was stopped;
  - `127.0.0.1:7866` is closed.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Start a new issue-local #596 daemon from `target\release\synapse-mcp.exe` on a fresh port (use `7867` unless occupied) with fresh DB/log/appdata/localappdata/token state.
  2. Verify process table, binary path/hash, socket listener, unauth `/health=401`, auth `/health ok=true`, and strict Inspector `tools/list` for `set_capture_target`, `observe`, `health`, `find`, `storage_inspect`, and `release_all`.
  3. Start/restart the deterministic `Issue596CaptureTarget` WPF target, read target state file, HWND, DWM bounds, client bounds, monitor geometry/DPI, and UIA element id/bbox.
  4. Trigger real Inspector MCP `tools/call set_capture_target` and read separate health/observe/physical SoTs after each target: primary with min interval 1, monitor0, window HWND, element_window, monitor1.
  5. Cover edges with before/after SoT readbacks: invalid monitor, hidden/disappeared element now rejected with state unchanged, structurally invalid target, closed HWND, forced DXGI monitor path, forced DXGI window reject.
  6. Cleanup with real `release_all`, stop target/daemon(s), verify ports/processes absent, then update issue evidence and close #596 if accepted.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T02:27:37-05:00
- Active issue remains #596.
- Latest accepted/rejected runtime evidence:
  - prior isolated daemon PID `30420` / `127.0.0.1:7865` hung during real Inspector `tools/call set_capture_target` for `element_window`;
  - separate `/health` read timed out while the process still owned the socket, so the run was rejected after proving primary/monitor/window readbacks only;
  - PID `30420` was stopped and port `7865` is closed.
- Root cause and patch:
  - `CaptureController::switch_to` synchronously joined the previous capture thread;
  - WGC had been started with `GraphicsHandler::start(settings)`, where external shutdown can only happen from a later frame callback;
  - `crates/synapse-capture/src/platform/windows/capture.rs` now uses `GraphicsHandler::start_free_threaded(settings)` and `CaptureControl::stop()` so stop requests post `WM_QUIT` to the WGC message-loop thread;
  - `GraphicsHandler::new` sets and records the actual callback thread priority.
- Supporting checks passed after the patch:
  - `cargo fmt`;
  - `cargo check -p synapse-capture -p synapse-mcp -j 2`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-capture switching_capture_target_stops_previous_session -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-capture dxgi_backend_rejects_window_targets_before_thread_spawn -- --nocapture`;
  - `cargo test -p synapse-capture capture_thread_priority_is_recorded -- --nocapture`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Run `cargo fmt --check`, `git diff --check`, relevant focused tests/schema checks, and `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.
  2. Start a fresh isolated #596 repo-built HTTP daemon, verify process/binary/socket, unauth/auth health, and strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  3. Recreate/read physical SoTs: monitors/DPI, WPF target HWND/bounds/DWM bounds, target UIA element id/bbox, storage/log counts.
  4. Trigger real MCP `set_capture_target` primary -> monitor0 -> window -> element_window -> monitor1 and read separate health/observe/physical SoTs after each.
  5. Cover forced DXGI monitor path plus edges: invalid monitor index, disappeared element, closed HWND, min interval floor, and structurally invalid target.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T01:31:06-05:00
- Active issue is #596.
- Patch in progress:
  - M1 `set_capture_target` now drives a real `CaptureController` and exposes `capture_runtime` through set response, `health`, and `observe` diagnostics.
  - capture controller readback includes status, target, selected/effective backend, generation, min interval, cursor/dirty flags, frames captured/dropped, channel len/capacity, thread priority, and stop flag.
  - min update interval is floored at 16 ms for manual/profile observation metadata.
  - monitor targets are prevalidated on Windows; forced DXGI rejects window targets; `element_window` re-resolves the UIA element before using its HWND.
- Supporting checks already passed:
  - capture DXGI/window validation test;
  - M1 interval floor test;
  - M1 inactive runtime readback test;
  - touched-crate cargo check;
  - schema sanitize;
  - m4 tools-list.
- Current dirty files are #596-owned code/model/test changes plus unrelated `README.md`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Run `cargo fmt --check`, `git diff --check`, focused checks as needed, and `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.
  2. Start an isolated HTTP daemon from `target\release\synapse-mcp.exe` with issue-local DB/logs on a fresh port.
  3. Verify process/binary/socket, unauth/auth health, and strict MCP Inspector `tools/list` for `set_capture_target`, `observe`, `health`, `find`, `storage_inspect`, and `release_all`.
  4. Create/read physical SoTs: monitor geometry/DPI, deterministic target window title/HWND/bounds, target UIA element IDs/bboxes, storage/log counts.
  5. Trigger real MCP `set_capture_target` primary/monitor/window/element_window cycles and read separate health/observe/runtime/physical SoTs after each.
  6. Cover edges: invalid monitor index, closed window HWND, disappeared element_window, `min_update_interval_ms=1` floor to 16, structurally invalid target, and forced DXGI monitor path.
  7. If manual FSV passes, update state, commit with `[skip ci]`, post #596 RESOLVED evidence, close #596, remove stale in-progress label, and continue the queue.

  - title `scenario(stress): capture-target thrash - Graphics->DXGI fallback, multi-monitor, DPI`;
  - START comment https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/596#issuecomment-4599199311;
  - assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
- #596 intent:
  - prove `set_capture_target` switches primary/monitor/window/element_window cleanly under rapid reconfiguration;
  - verify `observe` after each switch against physical SoTs;
  - cover Graphics Capture->DXGI fallback where locally forceable;
  - verify per-monitor DPI/bounds do not double-apply (#591 regression guard).
- Planned SoTs:
  - Win32 monitor geometry and DPI;
  - target window title/HWND/bounds and UIA element bboxes;
  - cursor position where useful;
  - real MCP `observe` foreground/capture diagnostics;
  - isolated storage row counts/log bytes for capture target changes.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Inspect `set_capture_target` and capture implementation paths before editing.
  2. Read prior DPI/capture relevant commits/issues if needed.
  3. Build/launch an isolated repo-built `synapse-mcp` daemon for #596 and verify process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  4. Run manual MCP FSV for happy target-cycle path and edges: invalid monitor index, closed window HWND, disappeared element/window, and min update interval floor.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T01:05:39-05:00
- #595 is ready for closeout.
- Product patch:
  - file `crates/synapse-a11y/src/platform/windows/snapshot.rs`;
  - normal UIA child traversal now streams through raw `UITreeWalker` sibling calls with node/deadline checks before each child;
  - bulk `find_all_build_cache(TreeScope::Children)` remains only for UWP app-frame/CoreWindow fallback classes;
  - raw pattern supplement is gated to Notepad root windows;
  - tests cover budget/deadline helper and Notepad-only supplement gating.
- Accepted manual MCP/SoT evidence directory: `.runs\595\fanout-fsv-20260602T0037`.
  - isolated repo-built daemon PID `64060`, bind `127.0.0.1:7864`, strict Inspector `tools/list` 80 tools, and `tools/call` triggers for `health`, `observe`, `find`, `reality_baseline`, `observe_delta`, `storage_inspect`, and `release_all`;
  - deterministic target PID `62812`, title `Issue595FanoutTarget`, 10k item/state/UIA SoT readbacks;
  - happy `observe depth=6 max_elements=500`: element count 184, `CF_EVENTS/CF_OBSERVATIONS` 0->1, daemon elapsed ~403ms with `A11Y_SNAPSHOT_WALK_TRUNCATED reason="deadline"`;
  - happy `find Issue595 Item 00042`: exact name/automation id/bbox matched independent UIA;
  - baseline/rename/delta: `CF_KV` baseline/head rows, target renamed to `Issue595 Renamed`, then 8 reality deltas persisted;
  - edges: `max_elements=1`, no-result `find`, depth-0 boundary, max-elements-0 clamp boundary, structurally invalid unknown param with storage unchanged, minimized-window `find window_hwnd`, and Calculator/UWP `CalculatorResults` smoke.
- Cleanup completed:
  - Inspector `release_all` returned zero held inputs;
  - target PID `62812`, CalculatorApp PID `29856`, daemon PID `64060`, and port `7864` are absent;
  - `ApplicationFrameHost` PID `18732` is now Windows Settings and was preserved.
- Final supporting checks passed:
  - `cargo fmt --check`
  - `git diff --check` with line-ending warnings only
  - `cargo test -p synapse-a11y collection_limit_reason -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-a11y raw_pattern_supplement -- --nocapture`

  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --test m4_tools_list -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`
  - final release SHA256 `C5415C7A2153613FC5C9BC654C3ADB99A939F83D7BC2A6FA9F7CF206A41DC57A`, length `46485504`, timestamp `2026-06-02T06:05:23Z`.
- Important caveats:
  - configured chat MCP loaded but is a long-lived stale daemon and still took ~28s on a wired `find` against the 10k target; do not use that stale daemon as #595 acceptance evidence.
  - Inspector empty-query CLI encoding did not produce a clean empty-string server trigger, so no empty-query verdict is claimed; no-result `find` covers the empty/no-match behavior expected by the issue.
  - `README.md` is unrelated/user-owned; do not stage.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Stage only `crates/synapse-a11y/src/platform/windows/snapshot.rs` plus `STATE/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `STATE/DECISION_LOG.md`, `STATE/HEARTBEAT.md`, and `STATE/RECOVERY_NOTES.md`.
  2. Confirm `README.md` is excluded from the index.
  3. Commit `fix(a11y): stream UIA fanout snapshots (#595) [skip ci]`, push, post RESOLVED evidence to #595, close #595, and remove stale `status:in-progress` if present.
  4. Refresh the live queue and take #596 unless GitHub changed.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T00:36:51-05:00
- Active issue remains #595:
  - title `scenario(stress): UIA fanout storm - observe/find under 10k+ element trees`;
  - START comment https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/595#issuecomment-4598866903;
  - assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
- Wake-up after compaction was completed again:
  - doctrine files, `STATE/*`, #351, #595, live queue, git status/log/branch all read;
  - wired Synapse MCP `health`, `storage_inspect`, `observe`, and `find` returned successfully.
- Important reconciliation:
  - disk state at `00:18` described the first budget guard patch, but the later manual run found a second real defect.
  - real MCP `observe`/`find` against the 10k WPF target took ~26-27s because `FindAllBuildCache(TreeScope::Children)` bulk-materialized 10k children before Synapse could enforce its node/deadline budget. Those results were rejected as FSV evidence.
- Current #595 patch in `crates/synapse-a11y/src/platform/windows/snapshot.rs`:
  - keeps the original `collection_limit_reason` budget/deadline guards;
  - adds a `UITreeWalker` to `SnapshotWalk`;
  - streams normal child enumeration one sibling at a time with budget/deadline checks before each child;
  - limits bulk child enumeration to UWP app-frame/CoreWindow classes to preserve the #582 boundary behavior;
  - limits the raw `File`/`Edit`/`View` supplement to Notepad roots so high-fanout targets are not scanned by that workaround.
- Supporting checks passed after this patch:

- Runtime state:
  - stale isolated daemon PID `79940` / port `7863` was stopped.
  - WPF target PID `62812`, title `Issue595FanoutTarget`, remains live and should be reused or replaced for the patched run.
  - `README.md` is unrelated/user-owned; do not stage it.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Start fresh isolated repo-built daemon on a new #595 port (for example `127.0.0.1:7864`) with issue-local DB/log paths and token from `%APPDATA%\synapse\token.txt` without printing the token.
  2. Verify process/socket/binary, unauth/auth health, and strict MCP Inspector `tools/list` for `observe`, `find`, `reality_baseline`, `observe_delta`, `storage_inspect`, and `release_all`.
  3. Read target state/window/UIA SoTs before the trigger.
  4. Trigger real MCP `observe depth=6 max_elements=500`; accept only if the separate after-read shows bounded storage/log state and daemon elapsed time no longer reflects bulk 10k enumeration.
  5. Run `find`, `reality_baseline` + mutate + `observe_delta`, and edges: `max_elements=1`, no-result/empty query, invalid params, minimized target, and UWP/CoreWindow smoke.
  6. Finish with final supporting checks, cleanup target/daemon, diff review, commit `[skip ci]`, RESOLVED comment, close #595, then continue the queue.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-02T00:18:00-05:00
- Active issue remains #595:
  - title `scenario(stress): UIA fanout storm - observe/find under 10k+ element trees`;
  - START comment https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/595#issuecomment-4598866903;
  - assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
- Required wake-up was re-run after compaction and reconciled:
  - #351 confirms manual FSV only and no GitHub Actions/CI.
  - live queue still has #594 parent, active #595, #624/#625 blocked on the Daybreak operator-only boundary, and #596-#604/#629-#634 open.
  - wired Synapse MCP `health`, `storage_inspect`, `observe`, and `find` loaded through the real configured client.
- Current #595 patch:
  - file: `crates/synapse-a11y/src/platform/windows/snapshot.rs`;
  - root cause: `collect_nodes` could collect all siblings from a large flat `find_all_build_cache(TreeScope::Children)` result even after `SNAPSHOT_NODE_BUDGET=4000`, because the prior guard only stopped descent;
  - fix: `collection_limit_reason` checks budget/deadline before collection, before child enumeration, and before recursing into remaining siblings; sibling collection now breaks at the budget/deadline and logs `A11Y_SNAPSHOT_WALK_TRUNCATED`.
- Supporting checks already passed after patch:
  - `cargo fmt`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-a11y collection_limit_reason -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo check -p synapse-a11y -j 2`
  - `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`
  - `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`
  - latest release binary readback from that build: length `46479360`, SHA256 `291051081606485F341561FABB67AA44A80E4A179DC2D911B42EB4C90B421B0D`, `LastWriteTimeUtc=2026-06-02T05:10:43.48732Z`.
- Issue-local manual target:
  - `.runs\595\fanout-fsv-20260602T0018\target\issue595_target.ps1`;
  - launches visible WinForms `Issue595FanoutTarget`;
  - deterministic `ListBox` counts/prefixes/state file: 0/500/4000/10000 items, sentinel `Issue595 Item 03500`, renamed sentinel `Issue595 Renamed 03500`, `Select3500`, `Minimize`, `Exit`.
- Current worktree:
  - `README.md` dirty and unrelated/user-owned; do not stage.
  - `crates/synapse-a11y/src/platform/windows/snapshot.rs` dirty for #595.
  - state files dirty for #595 resume context.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Launch target with `powershell.exe -STA -File .runs\595\fanout-fsv-20260602T0018\target\issue595_target.ps1 -StatePath .runs\595\fanout-fsv-20260602T0018\target-state.json`; hide only the console helper, leave target window visible.
  2. Read target process/window/state-file SoTs and do a separate UIA/visible read to confirm 10k count/sentinel.
  3. Launch isolated repo-built `synapse-mcp.exe --mode http` on a fresh port with DB `.runs\595\fanout-fsv-20260602T0018\db` and logs `.runs\595\fanout-fsv-20260602T0018\logs`.
  4. Verify daemon process/socket/binary hash, unauth `/health=401`, auth `/health ok=true`, strict Inspector `tools/list` with `observe`, `find`, `observe_delta`, `reality_baseline`, `storage_inspect`, and `release_all`.
  5. Run manual MCP FSV:
     - happy observe depth 6/max 500 against the 10k tree; after-read target state, isolated storage row counts, daemon log `A11Y_SNAPSHOT_WALK_TRUNCATED`, and bounded node counts.
     - `find` sentinel query such as `Issue595 Item 03500` or visible selected sentinel; separate target/UIA readback.
     - baseline then rename target and call `observe_delta`; read CF_KV/head/delta rows plus target state file.
     - edges: empty/no-result find, `max_elements=1`, minimized target, invalid params, UWP/CoreWindow smoke where available.

  - `324_patched12_health_post_compaction2.txt`
  - `325_patched12_tools_list_post_compaction2.txt`
- Accepted #628 sub-evidence so far:
  - targeted `act_scroll.at` moved Playwright DOM `scrollY` from `0` to `1278` and isolated `CF_ACTION_LOG` from `0` to `2`.
  - `act_type into_element` on the target Chrome search input wrote exact Playwright DOM value `vega` with length `4` and isolated `CF_ACTION_LOG` moved from `2` to `4`.
  - UIA immediate readback for the `act_type` path still warned `after_len=0`, so the verdict for browser typing is the external Playwright DOM readback, not the tool return or UIA readback.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Reset server and navigate Playwright to `http://127.0.0.1:8763/`.
  2. Raise/check target Chrome HWND `0x12068a` before coordinate-dependent triggers.
  3. Run the full #628 happy path through real Synapse MCP triggers with Playwright/server/storage SoT before/after: search, late-loaded control, modal, iframe, form fill, moved/scroll target, and submit.
  4. Run >=3 edges: empty, boundary, and structurally invalid, with before/after SoT reads.
  5. If any successful tool response lacks the expected SoT delta, fix the root cause before continuing.

  3. Test `act_type into_element` on the search field with known text `vega`; read Playwright DOM before/after and isolated `storage_inspect`.
  4. If the value is exact, continue the full happy path and edge FSV. If it appends or contaminates text, fix `act_type` and rebuild/relaunch before proceeding.

  - Playwright MCP PID `39204` was previously listening on `::1:8932`; recheck before using it;
  - server `state.json` currently has no submissions and no iframe messages.
- Old #628 isolated daemon PID `56124` / port `7857` was released and stopped before the latest release build.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Start a fresh isolated repo-built `synapse-mcp` daemon on a new port, e.g. `127.0.0.1:7858`, with a fresh #628 DB/log path.
  2. Use official MCP Inspector strict `tools/list`, authenticated `health`, and a process/socket/binary readback for the new daemon.
  3. Reset/reload the browser marathon page, making sure Synapse and Playwright observe the same Chrome/page.
  4. Trigger through real Synapse MCP `tools/call` only, then read Playwright DOM/server/page state and Synapse storage/action log separately.
  5. Cover happy path plus late-loaded control, moved/scroll/DPI element, modal, iframe, empty/boundary/structurally-invalid inputs.

  - no visible/live `Issue615` or fanout top-level window is present by OS window enumeration;
  - wired `find` is currently blocked by the Excel `RuntimeId EMPTY` defect being fixed under #627;
  - fixture source shows the #615 buttons only mutate the old WinForms fixture item panel or close the form.
- Continue active #627:
  - keep the current isolated repo-built daemon/Excel run if still alive;
  - finish remaining spreadsheet edges: large paste, undo/redo, structurally invalid input, save-dialog handling;
  - save the workbook, independently parse `.xlsx` bytes/worksheet/formula/chart SoT, run final supporting checks, post #627 evidence, close #627, commit with `[skip ci]`, and continue the open issue queue.

- Evidence directory: `.runs\626\pianist-fsv-20260601T1709`.
- Key accepted behavior:
  - Isolated audio-enabled repo-built daemon PID `79620`, bind `127.0.0.1:7854`, strict Inspector tools-list 80 tools, required #626 tools present.
  - Local Chrome piano target showed `Audio: armed` and clean counters after Arm/Clear.
  - Happy Ode run: `14_act_combo_happy_ode.json` scheduled 15 steps; OCR after showed `Audio notes: 15`, `Play count: 15`, `Wrong keys: 0`, and exact Ode melody.
  - Overlapped audio run: `19_audio_tail_mid_long_ode48.json` showed nonzero loopback PCM (`peak=5809`, `rms_db=-33.3`, 49 active buckets); OCR after showed `Audio notes: 48`, `Play count: 48`.
  - Empty and non-monotonic combos failed closed and left page/storage unchanged.
  - Muted run showed visible `Muted notes: 4` while `audio_tail` stayed all zero.
  - Wrong-key recovery showed `wrong key x` followed by `C4 recovered after x`.
  - Back-to-back combos produced `C4 D4 E4 G4 F4 E4`.
  - 256-step boundary used the wired MCP client because Inspector CLI hit Windows command-line length; `mcp__synapse.act_combo` accepted `scheduled_steps=256`, OCR showed `Play count: 256`, `Muted notes: 256`, `Audio notes: 0`, and wired storage/reflex rows recorded combo active->expired.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T17:00:00-05:00
- #625 is blocked and state was committed/pushed:
  - BLOCKED evidence: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/625#issuecomment-4596839011
  - commit `0c854e8 docs(state): record issue 625 block [skip ci]`
  - `git status --short --branch` read clean after push.
- Active issue is #626:
  - title `scenario(showcase): autonomous pianist - act_combo song verified by audio_tail`
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/626#issuecomment-4596846733
  - assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
- #626 FSV target:
  - Launch/navigate Chrome to an online or local piano surface.
  - Map notes to keys and trigger a recognizable melody using real `act_press`/`act_combo`.
  - Read separate SoTs: loopback `audio_tail`, visible key highlight through `observe`/UIA/pixels where available, storage/action logs, and browser/process state.
  - Edges: tempo at combo step limit, muted/silent audio, wrong-key recovery, back-to-back combos, empty sequence, boundary/step-limit, structurally invalid params.
- Current known setup:
  - wired stdio MCP runtime is healthy, but `health.subsystems.audio.status=disabled`; #626 likely needs a repo-built isolated daemon launched with `--enable-audio`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Inspect audio_tail/audio_transcribe, act_combo/act_press, act_launch/Chrome profile, and observe/pixel/UIA implementations/tests.
  2. Identify a deterministic piano target, preferably local HTML if it avoids network flakiness while still using Chrome and real audio output.
  3. Build/launch isolated repo-built `synapse-mcp` with audio enabled, strict Inspector tools-list, and separate process/socket/auth SoT readbacks.
  4. Run #626 manual MCP FSV and patch any defects exposed.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T16:56:00-05:00
- #625 reversible evidence is complete and GitHub disposition is posted.
- User's `Issue615FanoutTarget` question:
  - No live #615 fixture process/window or wired MCP element is present now.
  - The fixture buttons in `.runs\615\target\issue615_target.ps1` only mutate an in-window `ItemPanel` or close that temporary WinForms target; they are not product UI.
- #625 evidence summary:
  - Wired Synapse MCP health/profile/storage/observe/tool calls were live after compaction; process readback found `synapse-mcp.exe` PID `66040` plus stdio child PID `70072`.
  - EQ log stayed unchanged at length `2464677`, SHA256 `E563074084A7F5A291AC6FBF77746B993AB086F747C6C111C39503B6BF475368`.
  - Readiness persisted blockers for non-EQ foreground/gameplay UI/chat/HUD/food-drink.
  - Autocombat failed closed before gameplay because active profile was `vscode`; `CF_ACTION_LOG` advanced and recorded `ACTION_TARGET_INVALID active_profile_mismatch` for `issue625-autocombat-deny-vscode`.
  - DynamicJEPA, trajectory export, predictive model fit/predict, surprise confirmed/mismatch/missing-prediction, action-prior samples, and scorecard rows were all triggered through real MCP tools and read back from `CF_KV`/file bytes.
  - Scorecard row `everquest/action_prior_scorecard/v1/everquest.live/issue625-scorecard-window` persisted with `sample_count=3`, `evaluated_count=2`, `abstention_count=1`, `low_confidence_action_count=1`, top1/top3/useful accuracy `1.0`, and competence status `low_confidence_action_forced`.
  - Invalid duplicate-scorecard edge failed closed with `TOOL_PARAMS_INVALID` and no `issue625-scorecard-duplicate-invalid` row; `CF_KV` stayed `48`.
  - Supporting checks passed: fmt, focused scorecard/predictive/surprise tests, schema sanitize, M4 tools-list, MCP check, release build, and diff check.
  - Release binary SHA256: `4AF3EB0E332F6A7AFD5DBBFAD1169EB051371040D5C24CF033662AC3615F78AD`.
- #625 disposition:
  - BLOCKED evidence comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/625#issuecomment-4596839011
  - Label readback shows `status:blocked`; `status:in-progress` was removed.
  - Next: commit state updates with `[skip ci]`, push, refresh queue, and continue to the next open issue because #625 is blocked only on an operator-only external/legal/account action.
- Exact remaining operator-only action for #625:
  - Operator must personally review/respond to the Daybreak EULA/account agreement, log in/select character if appropriate, and put `Thenumberone` in visible in-world state with safe target availability.
  - Agent must not click legal/account/login/character-select/chat controls.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T16:31:30-05:00
- #624 has been committed and pushed:
  - commit `9de5ee3 fix(mcp): guard EverQuest account gates (#624) [skip ci]`
  - BLOCKED evidence: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/624#issuecomment-4596661903
  - #624 labels read back include `status:blocked`; worktree was clean after push.
- Active issue is #625:
  - title `scenario(stress): EverQuest autocombat soak + survival/predictive/surprise/scorecard`
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/625#issuecomment-4596668371
  - assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
- Current host state:
  - wired Synapse MCP `health` ok;
  - foreground is VS Code, not EverQuest;
  - #624 proved EverQuest is blocked by the Daybreak EULA/account agreement when focused, and the agent must not click legal/account/login controls.
- Exact next actions for #625:
  1. Inspect autocombat/readiness/predictive/surprise/action-prior implementations and tests.
  2. Read SoTs before triggers: active storage counts, EQ log length/hash/tail, foreground/EQ state, relevant existing trajectory/domain rows.
  3. Trigger real safe MCP calls for readiness and synthetic predictive/surprise/action-prior storage paths where possible.
  4. If `everquest_autocombat` is blocked by account/EULA/in-world requirements, document exact operator-only action and mark #625 blocked after all reversible safe work is complete.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T16:24:00-05:00
- Wake-up after compaction was completed and reconciled against live GitHub/git/MCP state.
- User's `Issue615FanoutTarget` question was answered and rechecked:
  - no live #615 fixture window or Synapse element is visible now;
  - those windows are old #615 WinForms UIA fanout stress fixtures, not product UI.
- Active issue is #624:
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/624#issuecomment-4596141027
  - open, assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
  - live open queue: #594 plus #595-#604 and #624-#634.
- Current git/worktree:
  - branch `main`, HEAD `841679c docs(state): record issue 624 start [skip ci]`.
  - modified files: `STATE/*`, `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/everquest_ui_context.rs`, `crates/synapse-profiles/profiles/everquest.live.toml`, `docs/computergames/05_mcp_tool_surface.md`, `docs/computergames/26_everquest_live_eval.md`.
- #624 implementation patch:
  - EverQuest account/login gate now detects EULA, end-user license agreement, terms/privacy, `I AGREE`, and `I DECLINE`.
  - Action denial reason is `everquest_login_or_account_gate_visible`.
  - Docs describe account/legal gates as non-in-world and raw legal/account text as non-persisted.
- #624 evidence already captured:
  - Isolated repo-built daemon PID `34624`, bind `127.0.0.1:7853`, binary SHA256 `3BA384BF72EC44DC1106235A4809CEDCEBFB056353527FEA57B6D109C14E3AB7`, strict Inspector tools-list 80 tools.
  - EULA/account-gate behavior: real MCP `observe`, `everquest_survival_readiness`, `everquest_chat_input_state`, `act_keymap inventory`, `everquest_loc_probe`, and `everquest_current_state`; denied action/log readbacks prove no gameplay/chat input was sent and EQ log bytes stayed SHA256 `E563074084A7F5A291AC6FBF77746B993AB086F747C6C111C39503B6BF475368`.
  - Synthetic domain/trajectory/episode export already exists; episode export SHA256 `7386a7f8b26cd6fc8e262813eff9167785d13610aaf8e68bbd9fcce3949dc2ef`.
  - ContextGraph ingest/search succeeded through real wired Synapse MCP:
    - ingest row `everquest/contextgraph_ingest/v1/everquest.live/7386a7f8b26cd6fc8e262813eff9167785d13610aaf8e68bbd9fcce3949dc2ef/issue624-synth-trajectory.issue624-synth-consider`
    - fingerprint `d5d91675-9303-4b0f-bdd6-2f0326abffdb`
    - search row `everquest/contextgraph_search/v1/everquest.live/issue624-synth-search-wired-warm`
    - search result/citation count `1`, same fingerprint and export hash.
  - Active safe/read-only storage chain persisted current state, map sensor, four outcome rows, hazard memory, safe-area memory, planner consult, planner guard, route plan, world-model transition, and world summary. Final `storage_inspect` read `CF_KV=33`.
  - Physical SoTs: EQ log length `2464677`, SHA256 `E563074084A7F5A291AC6FBF77746B993AB086F747C6C111C39503B6BF475368`; `maps\nektulos.txt` has `To_Neriak` at line `5974`.
- Captured #624 edges:
  - login/account EULA gate denial;
  - non-EverQuest foreground;
  - synthetic visible unsent chat text guard fail;
  - structurally-invalid planner source ref fail-closed;
  - absent valid-shaped EQ log path fail-closed with no `CF_KV` change;
  - reality audit profile mismatch fail-closed.
- Cleanup and final checks:
  - Real Inspector `release_all` on isolated daemon `127.0.0.1:7853` returned zero held inputs.
  - PID `34624` was stopped; process and port `7853` readbacks returned no rows.
  - Passed: `cargo fmt --check`; focused UI-context tests; EverQuest profile parse test; schema sanitize; tools-list; `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`; `scripts\check_docs.ps1`; release build; `git diff --check`.
  - Release binary SHA256 `31D62B2891F4AA17F7139BF4A5E52276521F7009E7B2C428D6FAFF15CBF5A374`, length `46392320`.
- Exact next steps:
  1. Commit with `[skip ci]`.
  2. Post #624 evidence and mark #624 blocked on the exact operator-only action: operator must personally review/respond to the Daybreak EULA/account agreement and put the character in-world.
  3. Refresh the queue and continue with the next open issue.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T16:02:28-05:00
- Wake-up after compaction is complete and reconciled against actual disk/GitHub/process/MCP state.
- User's `Issue615FanoutTarget` concern was rechecked:
  - no live Issue615/fanout process or Synapse element exists now;
  - foreground is EverQuest;
  - `.runs\615\target\issue615_target.ps1` confirms the buttons are only a temporary #615 WinForms UIA fixture that mutates an in-window `ItemPanel` or closes itself.
- Active issue is #624:
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/624#issuecomment-4596141027
  - open, assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
  - live open queue: #594 plus #595-#604 and #624-#634.
- Git readback:
  - branch `main`
  - HEAD `841679c docs(state): record issue 624 start [skip ci]`
  - modified files are the #624 EULA/account-gate patch in `everquest_ui_context.rs`, `everquest.live.toml`, and the two EverQuest docs.
- #624 isolated daemon is still running:
  - PID `34624`, bind `127.0.0.1:7853`
  - binary `.runs\624\eula-guard-fsv-20260601T2034\bin\synapse-mcp-runtime.exe`

  - strict Inspector tools-list readback: 80 tools, missing none, all #624 tools present.
- Verified #624 evidence directory:
  - `.runs\624\eula-guard-fsv-20260601T2034`
  - EULA/account-gate guard FSV shows real MCP `observe`, `everquest_survival_readiness`, `everquest_chat_input_state`, `act_keymap`, `everquest_loc_probe`, and `everquest_current_state` calls; separate storage/log readbacks prove actions were denied and EQ log bytes did not change.
  - Synthetic domain/trajectory/episode export rows exist; exported episode file SHA256 is `7386a7f8b26cd6fc8e262813eff9167785d13610aaf8e68bbd9fcce3949dc2ef`.
- ContextGraph next action:
  1. Rerun `everquest_contextgraph_ingest` through the isolated daemon with `no_warm=false`, storage under the data root, wrapper `.runs\issue529\context-graph-mcp-wsl.cmd`, and a long timeout.
  2. If it succeeds, run separate `storage_inspect` and inspect ContextGraph storage directory/file SoTs.
  3. Then run `everquest_contextgraph_search` through real MCP and inspect returned provenance plus persisted search audit rows.
  4. If it fails, inspect the exact child stderr/root cause and continue reversible local setup.
- Operator-only boundary:
  - EQ is visible at the Daybreak EULA/account agreement. Do not click I Agree, I Decline, login, character select, or chat/account fields. Full in-world #624 happy path remains unavailable until the operator personally reviews/responds to the agreement and places the character in-world.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T15:16:27-05:00
- Wake-up after compaction is complete. Required doctrine/state/GitHub/git/MCP context was re-read and reconciled.

  - wired Synapse `find` found no `Issue615FanoutTarget`/`Show80` elements;
  - fixture source `.runs\615\target\issue615_target.ps1` confirms it was a temporary WinForms UIA stress target; buttons mutate the `ItemPanel` or close the form and are not product UI.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T14:28:42-05:00
- Active issue #622 has manual MCP FSV, cleanup, and supporting checks complete; no product-code patch was required.
- FSV evidence directory: `.runs\622\authoring-fsv-20260601T1350`.
  - Repo-built daemon was PID `59440`, bind `127.0.0.1:7850`, isolated DB `.runs\622\authoring-fsv-20260601T1350\db`, strict Inspector tools-list count 80.
  - Covered behavior:
    - zero-evidence authoring generate failed closed with no candidate row;
    - real observe/action/replay/reality evidence produced action/observation/event/KV rows and replay SHA256 `61AB2CC29986048235197AA336CCC34B86F9794445683C72223FE53AE6BABC1F`;
    - generate/list/inspect wrote candidate `issue622.accept` proposing `matches.add_exe=["powershell.exe"]`;
    - accept wrote state `accepted` and note, re-accept was idempotent;
    - export wrote 2883-byte accepted bundle SHA256 `D2790BD9118B9DB5790C4B56D382EA3872146688AD7057FA59EA23427AF9E37B`;
    - generate/reject wrote candidate `issue622.reject` with reason `issue622 reject reason`;
    - rejecting accepted, exporting missing candidate, list `limit=0`, malformed candidate id, and over-max `max_audit_rows=10001` all failed closed with storage unchanged;
    - 10000-row boundary used real `storage_put_probe_rows` to grow `CF_ACTION_LOG` `2 -> 10002`, then `profile_authoring_generate issue622.max max_audit_rows=10000` scanned/relevant 10000 rows and wrote a candidate row;
    - `profile_quality_refresh` wrote `profile_quality/v1/issue622.authoring`; separate report readback showed score `21`, sample size `1`, scanned action rows `10002`, relevant action rows `2`, observation rows `2`, event rows `3`;
    - stale edge (`stale_after_ns=1`) persisted stale evidence (`audit_rows_stale=2`, score `0`), invalid quality params failed closed, and a final non-stale refresh restored score `21`.
  - Cleanup completed: `release_all` zero, daemon stopped, port `7850` closed.
- Supporting checks passed: fmt, diff check, MCP check, profile quality tool test, replay record tool test, schema sanitize, m3 tools-list, release build; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp profile_authoring -- --nocapture` compiled but had no matching tests.
- Final release binary SHA256: `236992450A49D3177C1FCBF1D06F567C30CC54AA5F217C1F0D59BFDBADF23E01`.

  - Current exact next action: inspect `profile_authoring`, `profile_quality_refresh`, `replay_record`, evidence scanning/storage row formats, and supporting tests. Then launch a repo-built isolated daemon for manual MCP FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T13:41:30-05:00
- Active issue #621 has manual MCP FSV and supporting checks complete; no product-code patch was required.
- FSV evidence directory: `.runs\621\registry-fsv-20260601T1324`.
  - Repo-built daemon was PID `58848`, bind `127.0.0.1:7849`, isolated DB `.runs\621\registry-fsv-20260601T1324\db`, official Inspector strict `tools/list` count 80.
  - Covered install with expected digest, digest mismatch, scale 600-row registry import/search/report at `limit=1000`, deterministic export and duplicate import, conflicting import, disable+inspect, second-version install and rollback, rollback with no prior, poison contribution quarantine, >1000 contribution quarantine, malformed import, missing-profile contribution export, and invalid limit.
  - Final storage readback: `CF_PROFILES=617`, `CF_KV=1`, `CF_ACTION_LOG=0`; report scanned 617 registry rows and contribution search found two quarantined contribution rows.
  - Cleanup completed: `release_all` zero, daemon stopped, port `7849` closed.
- Supporting checks passed: fmt, diff check, MCP check, curated registry test, registry report test, package manifest test, schema sanitize, m3 tools-list, and release build.
- Final release binary SHA256: `08FEC90BE80C37B940AF9549335F901A8DACE52863FDA9F7990049F0A4A94890`.
- Exact next actions:

  - Closure readback: state `CLOSED`, closed at `2026-06-01T18:15:30Z`.
  - Worktree was clean after push/closure before this state-only update.

  - Claimed with `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`, assigned to `ChrisRoyse`.
  - Current exact next action: inspect profile registry implementation, manifest/schema files, storage row formats, and supporting tests. Then build release and run an isolated repo-built daemon for manual MCP FSV using official Inspector strict `tools/list`.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T13:04:31-05:00
- Active issue is #620.
- #620 implementation is patched locally; manual MCP behavior evidence, final supporting checks, release build, and diff review are complete. Commit, RESOLVED comment, closure, and queue continuation are next.
- Manual FSV run directory: `.runs\620\profile-fsv-20260601T1238-clean`.
  - Repo-built daemon PID `61244`, bind `127.0.0.1:7848`, isolated DB, isolated appdata/token, strict official Inspector tools-list count 80.
  - All 29 bundled profiles were activated through real Inspector `profile_activate`; each had separate `profile_list` + `health.subsystems.perception` readbacks matching active profile id, mode, capture target/source, min interval, and cursor setting. #620 title says 30, but live SoT has 29 profiles.
  - Matching foreground PowerShell `observe` read `mode=a11y_only` and `diagnostics.capture_config.source=profile:powershell`.
  - `act_keymap alias=clear` wrote `CF_ACTION_LOG` rows preserving alias `clear`, binding `ctrl+l`, keys `ctrl,l`, backend `software`, and foreground `powershell.exe`.
  - HUD specs are present for EverQuest/Luanti/Minecraft profiles. Live Luanti launched and matched the profile process/window, but host foreground remained PowerShell and mouse focus failed with access denied, so HUD-slot live readback is a documented explained gap under the issue acceptance.
  - Edges covered: unknown profile, same-profile reactivation, app-not-running/foreground mismatch, empty alias, unknown alias, and no bundled empty-keymap profile.
  - Cleanup completed: release_all zero, FSV-owned Luanti/Notepad processes stopped, daemon stopped, port `7848` closed.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Commit with `[skip ci]`.
  2. Post #620 RESOLVED evidence and close #620.
  3. Refresh the live queue.
  4. Take #621 next unless GitHub state changes.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T12:45:00-05:00
- Active issue is #620.
- The user's `Issue615FanoutTarget` concern has been checked: no #615 target windows/processes are currently visible/running. They were only the #615 synthetic UIA target and should not be considered product UI.
- Worktree has an uncommitted #620 patch:
  - M1 `active_capture_config`;
  - `observe.diagnostics.capture_config`;
  - `health.subsystems.perception` mode/capture readback;
  - `profile_activate` and foreground profile resolution apply profile mode/capture as well as action backend resolution;
  - `m3_profile_tools` regression checks activation health and observe mode/capture for a synthetic matching profile.
- Supporting checks already passed: core/perception/MCP checks, `m3_profile_tools`, core snapshots observation shape, perception regression, MCP context tests, schema sanitize, and core types.
- Remaining exact next actions:
  1. Run final local supporting checks as needed and `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.
  2. Launch an isolated repo-built HTTP daemon for #620 with `SYNAPSE_DB` under `.runs\620\...`.
  3. Prove process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  4. Manually FSV all 29 bundled profiles through real Inspector `profile_activate` calls with separate `profile_list` and `health.subsystems.perception` readbacks.
  5. Manually FSV representative matching-profile `observe`, HUD, `act_keymap` + `CF_ACTION_LOG`, and required edge cases.
  6. Post RESOLVED evidence to #620 only after FSV and final checks pass.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T11:18:00-05:00
- Active issue #618 `scenario(stress): storage pressure ladder - 5 levels + write-gating` is patched and manual MCP FSV evidence is captured.
- Worktree patch:
  - `crates/synapse-storage/src/lib.rs`: `Db::pressure_permits_write`.
  - `crates/synapse-reflex/src/storage.rs`: `ReflexRuntime::storage_pressure_permits_write`.
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/src/m3/storage.rs`: diagnostic probe writes cover all 11 CFs and fail explicitly with `STORAGE_WRITE_FAILED` under pressure refusal.
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/tests/m3_storage_tool.rs`: supporting pressure-gating regression.
- Manual FSV evidence is under `.runs\618\pressure-fsv-20260601T1108-patched`.
  - Repo-built daemon PID `56980`, bind `127.0.0.1:7846`, isolated DB, token `synapse-618-token`, strict Inspector `tools/list` count 80.
  - Initial SoT read: pressure `Normal`, all CF counts 0.
  - Ladder: exact thresholds stayed at the prior level; below thresholds entered L1/L2/L3/L4 with codes `STORAGE_DISK_PRESSURE_LEVEL_1..4`; L2/L3/L4 transitions compacted all 11 CFs; recovery to `Normal` emitted no new code and compacted 0.
  - Gating: L2 accepted `CF_OBSERVATIONS`; L3 refused `CF_OBSERVATIONS`, `CF_OCR_CACHE`, `CF_TELEMETRY`, `CF_MODEL_CACHE`, `CF_PROCESS_HISTORY` and allowed `CF_EVENTS`; L4 refused `CF_EVENTS`, `CF_ACTION_LOG`, `CF_KV`, `CF_OBSERVATIONS` and allowed only `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT`/`CF_SESSIONS`; empty `rows=0` to blocked `CF_EVENTS` no-opped; invalid `cf_name=NOT_A_CF` failed closed; recovery allowed `CF_OBSERVATIONS` again.
  - Separate `storage_inspect` readbacks confirmed the counts: final `Normal`, `CF_EVENTS=1`, `CF_OBSERVATIONS=2`, `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT=1`, `CF_SESSIONS=1`, blocked CFs unchanged.
  - Cleanup: `release_all` zeroed state, daemon PID `56980` stopped, port `7846` closed.
- Final supporting checks passed: `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`; `cargo check -p synapse-storage -j 2`; `cargo check -p synapse-reflex -j 2`; `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`; `cargo test -p synapse-storage pressure -- --nocapture`; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --test m3_storage_tool -- --nocapture`; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp schema_sanitize -- --nocapture`; `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.

  - Live queue after #616 closure: #594 plus #595-#604 and #617-#634.
  - #617 requires manual MCP FSV of `storage_put_probe_rows`, `storage_inspect`, and `storage_gc_once` against isolated CF row/size SoT under storage pressure and eviction edges.
- Current next action: inspect storage tool/cap/GC implementation and supporting tests, then launch a repo-built isolated daemon for #617 FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T10:12:14-05:00
- Active issue #616 has implementation, manual MCP FSV evidence, cleanup, final supporting checks, and diff review complete; commit, RESOLVED comment, close, and queue continuation are next.
- Patch in `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/reality.rs` makes `reality_audit` classify concrete compact-state drift instead of treating every physical mismatch as generic `rebase_required`.
- FSV evidence is in `.runs\616\audit-fsv-20260601T0945`:
  - repo-built daemon PID `80292`, bind `127.0.0.1:7844`, isolated DB, strict Inspector `tools/list` with 80 tools;
  - source unavailable/missing baseline wrote `reality/audit/v1/chrome/audit-01780325611288876400-0000000001`;
  - baseline+delta+no-drift wrote two delta rows and audit `...0000000002` with `in_sync`;

  - immediate rebase audit wrote audit `...0000000004` with `in_sync`;
  - major UI-structure drift wrote audit `...0000000006` with `major_drift`;
  - stale epoch wrote audit `...0000000007` with `rebase_required`;
  - invalid `depth=0` failed closed and left `CF_KV=18`, `CF_ACTION_LOG=14` unchanged.
- Cleanup is done: release_all called, target PID `13676` stopped, daemon PID `80292` stopped, port `7844` closed, no visible `Issue616*` or `Issue615FanoutTarget` windows remain.
- Final supporting checks passed: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`; full reality tests (20 passed); schema sanitize tests (3 passed); release build; `git diff --check` with line-ending warnings only.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T09:39:21-05:00
- Active issue #616 is patched locally but not yet fully verified or committed.
  - Patch in `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/reality.rs`: `reality_audit` now itemizes drift by comparing the stored head compact state to the fresh captured compact state, classifies field-level severity, distinguishes source unavailable/stale/mismatch cases, and persists changed paths in `RealityDriftItem`.
  - Focused checks passed: `cargo fmt`; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp reality_audit_ --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture` (6 passed).
  - Next action: run broader supporting checks/release build, then launch an isolated repo-built daemon for #616 manual MCP FSV.

  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/616#issuecomment-4593554251
  - Live queue after #615 closure: #594 plus #595-#604 and #616-#634.
  - #616 requires `reality_audit` drift verdicts to match physical divergence from the assumed baseline/head epoch/hash and to persist `CF_KV/reality/audit/*` rows through real MCP triggers.
- Current next action: inspect `reality_audit` implementation/tests and plan an isolated repo-built daemon FSV run for drift injection, no-drift, source-unavailable, minor/major boundary, audit-after-rebase, empty/no-change, and invalid params.

## #615 Closure Checkpoint
- Patch: `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/reality.rs` excludes incidental focus and parent `children_count` changes from the UIA high-fanout coalescing threshold while preserving changed-id metadata on emitted aggregate deltas.
- Manual MCP FSV evidence is under `.runs\615\fanout-fsv-20260601T0844-patched`.
  - Repo-built daemon PID `64500`, bind `127.0.0.1:7843`, strict Inspector `tools/list` returned 80 tools.
  - Physical target PID `79124`, title `Issue615FanoutTarget`, separate OS UIA reads confirmed item counts/names after real MCP `act_click` triggers.
  - Covered Show7 per-element, Show8 coalesced, Rename8 `uia_elements_changed`, Mixed8 coalesced, Show80/Clear snapshot-budget rebase with no `CF_KV` row growth, empty/no-change, invalid `depth=0`, and disappear8.
  - Cleanup stopped PID `79124`, stopped PID `64500`, and port `7843` no longer listens.

## #614 Patch Checkpoint
- Current worktree change: `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/reality.rs`.
- Patched:
  - omitted-profile `reality_baseline` now observes first, selects the active profile, and reuses that profile's existing head/baseline when `epoch_id` is omitted and `force_new_epoch=false`;
  - `observe_delta.since_epoch` now validates through the same reality key-segment validation used for baseline/audit epochs before stale-epoch comparison;
  - `capture_reality_observation` now fails closed on `depth=0`, `depth>6`, `max_elements=0`, or `max_elements>500` instead of clamping bypassed invalid values.
  - `observe_delta` now returns `profile_changed` rebase guidance for a known observed profile switch instead of failing requested-profile validation before the edge can be represented.
- Focused checks passed:
  - `cargo fmt`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp reality_baseline_reuses_observed_profile_when_profile_id_is_omitted --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture`

- Host-sensor plan: use Luanti (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\synapse\benchmarks\luanti\engine\5.16.1\luanti-5.16.1-win64\bin\luanti.exe`) for real foreground/UIA/HUD/entity/diagnostics deltas, Notepad/clipboard/filesystem tools for additional physical changes, and `--enable-audio` plus a local sound trigger for audio if loopback initializes.
- Next: launch isolated #614 daemon, strict Inspector `tools/list`, then manual FSV.

## #614 Manual FSV Evidence
- Main run directory: `.runs\614\reality-loop-fsv-20260601T0741-patched`.
- FS subrun directory: `.runs\614\fs-watch-fsv-20260601T0805`.
- Covered feeds:
  - baseline/head: CF_KV baseline/head rows for `issue614-luanti-20260601T0743` and `issue614-luanti-profiled-20260601T0746`;
  - foreground/focus/UIA/HUD/entity/audio/clipboard: 12-delta main cursor walk, CF_KV 3->15, SSE stream seq 1..12;
  - diagnostics: boundary `max_elements=1` changed `elements_truncated=false` to `true`;
  - filesystem: FS-watch subrun `/fs` created-file delta, CF_KV 2->3, file SHA256 readback;
  - audit: `reality_audit` persisted audit row and returned drift/rebase guidance.
- Edge cases:
  - empty/no-change: `since_seq=12` returned `no_changes`, no CF_KV delta rows;
  - missing baseline: `profile_id=missing614` returned `missing_baseline`;
  - stale epoch: old epoch returned `stale_epoch`;
  - profile change: Notepad foreground returned `profile_changed: head profile unprofiled but observed notepad`;
  - future/overflow/malformed/structural invalids: future seq, overflow seq, malformed epoch, and `depth=0` all failed closed.

## #614 Scope
- Goal: prove the delta-first reality model end to end across every sensor feed.
- Required runtime evidence:
  - real repo-built `synapse-mcp` daemon process/bind/auth/health/session/strict Inspector `tools/list`;
  - real MCP `tools/call` triggers for `reality_baseline`, `observe_delta`, `reality_audit`, and event-producing tools;
  - separate SoT readbacks for `CF_KV/reality/baseline/*`, `reality/head/*`, `reality/delta/*`, `reality/audit/*`, `reality_delta` SSE frames, and physical foreground/focus/UIA/HUD/entity/audio/clipboard/filesystem/diagnostics changes where available;
  - happy path plus missing baseline, stale epoch, profile-change mid-walk, future/overflow `since_seq`, empty/no-change, boundary, and structurally invalid params.

## #613 Manual FSV Evidence
- Final run directory: `.runs\613\subscribe-firehose-fsv-20260601T062230-patched`
- Daemon: PID `32356`, bind `127.0.0.1:7839`, repo release binary, isolated DB/watch/log dirs.
- Precondition: process/socket/auth readback passed; unauth `/health=401`; auth `/health ok=true`; official MCP Inspector strict `tools/list` returned 80 tools with #613 tools present.
- One-per-event: subscription `019e82ec-ebf5-7943-884e-03590d0a05f2` delivered exactly 3 frames for `/focused,/clipboard,/fs`; stream/event seqs `1,2,3`; no drops; file and clipboard physical SoTs matched marker `issue613-patched-oneper-20260601T062403456`.
- 8-deep filter: subscription `019e82ee-5d56-72f2-92c0-00e3c4a73063` accepted regex/in_set/exists filter at max depth and delivered only `/clipboard` and `/fs` from four published reality deltas.
- Firehose/backpressure: subscription `019e82ef-c53f-7e13-ae2c-cfea7dbd3ae8`; 5000 known events posted; stats read `ring_len=4096`, `oldest_event_seq=904`, `latest_event_seq=4999`, `dropped_total=904`, `events_dropped_for_subscriber=904`, `lossy_pending=true`; replay had 1 lossy preface and 4096 event frames.
- Edges: depth 9, invalid regex, invalid data path, and bad buffer size rejected through strict Inspector; empty filter All delivered event seq `613000`; subscribe/immediate cancel produced `cancelled=true`, stats 404 after cancel and after matching publish.
- Cleanup: subscriptions cancelled, `sse_subscribers=0`, `release_all` zero, daemon stopped, port `7839` closed.

## Standing Rules
- Re-read `C:\code\Synapse\docs\AICodingAgentSuperPrompt.md`, `C:\Users\hotra\Downloads\AICodingAgentSuperPrompt.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `STATE/*` after compaction.
- GitHub Issues are the only coordination surface.
- No GitHub Actions/CI dispatch, waits, or CI-gated claims.
- Commits pushed by this agent must include `[skip ci]`.
- Automated checks/benches are supporting regression evidence only; they are not FSV.
- Missing local prerequisites are acquisition/setup work, not blockers, unless only a specific operator-only hard-to-reverse external action remains.
