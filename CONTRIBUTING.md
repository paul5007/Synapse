# Contributing to Synapse

Thanks for your interest in Synapse. This document covers how to propose changes
and, importantly, the **licensing terms for contributions** — Synapse is
dual-licensed (noncommercial + paid commercial), so contributions need to be
made under terms that keep that model possible.

## Licensing of contributions

By submitting a contribution (a pull request, patch, or any other work) to this
project, you agree that:

1. **You have the right to submit it.** The contribution is your original work,
   or you otherwise have the rights to submit it under these terms, and you sign
   off on it under the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
   (use `git commit -s` to add a `Signed-off-by` line).
2. **You license it to the maintainer broadly.** You grant Chris Royse (the
   project maintainer / licensor) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   royalty-free, irrevocable copyright and patent license to use, reproduce,
   modify, distribute, and **sublicense** your contribution, **including the
   right to license it under the project's [PolyForm Noncommercial
   License](LICENSE.md) and under separate paid [commercial
   licenses](COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md)**.
3. **You keep your rights too.** You retain copyright in your contribution and
   may use it elsewhere. This grant is in addition to your own rights, not a
   transfer of them.

If you cannot agree to these terms, please do not submit a contribution. If your
employer has rights to work you create, make sure you have permission to
contribute under these terms before doing so.

## Before you start

For anything larger than a small fix, **open an issue first** to discuss the
approach. This avoids wasted work on changes that don't fit the architecture or
the roadmap (see the README "What's left on the docket" section and
[docs/](docs/)).

## Development workflow

1. Use the current stable Rust toolchain (verified with Rust 1.95).
2. Build and check the workspace:
   ```bash
   cargo build --workspace
   cargo fmt --all
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
3. Synapse is **Windows-native** for its real perception/action paths (Win32
   `SendInput`, UI Automation, WGC/DXGI, ViGEmBus). Behavior that touches those
   surfaces should be verified on Windows — see
   [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the project's manual Full State Verification (FSV)
   expectations. Automated tests and CI are supporting evidence, not a substitute
   for verifying real behavior.
4. Keep commits focused and write clear messages. Reference the issue number
   where applicable.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs scoped to one logical change.
- Include the reasoning and any verification you performed.
- Make sure `cargo fmt --check` and the build pass locally before requesting
  review.
- Sign off your commits (`git commit -s`) to assert the DCO and the contribution
  terms above.

## Code of conduct

This project follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating,
