# Issue 852 Mining Acceptance FSV - 2026-06-24

Issue: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/852

This transcript records the manual full-state verification run for the mining
acceptance issue. The planted routine was verified against a fresh physical
RocksDB store through the real HTTP MCP daemon surface, then the shared daemon
was rebuilt and restarted from this checkout to prove the same tools are
available to the live Codex-connected Synapse runtime.

## Durable Script

The repeatable FSV script is:

```powershell
.\scripts\fsv\issue-852-mining-acceptance.ps1 `
  -SynapseMcpExe .\target\release\synapse-mcp.exe
```

The script starts an isolated loopback daemon with a temp profile and temp DB,
uses Streamable HTTP MCP directly, seeds probe rows, verifies the full
timeline->episode->routine->digest chain, calls `session_end`, stops the temp
daemon, and removes the temp root in `finally`.

Direct HTTP was used for the script because the current Codex process can have
stale generated schemas immediately after tool-surface changes. No new Codex
terminal was opened or required.

## Code Surface

The normal tool profile now exposes the routine lifecycle and label-read tools
needed for the acceptance path:

- `routine_update`
- `routine_label_export`

`routine_label_export` is classified as a safe read-only MCP tool. The mutating
`routine_update` tool remains outside the safe list and is still gated as a
non-destructive mutating MCP call by the permission policy.

## Shared Daemon Readback

After the isolated FSV passed, full setup was run from this checkout:

```powershell
.\scripts\synapse-setup.ps1 -SourceDir (Resolve-Path .) -ForceRestart
```

Setup readback:

- Built binary:
  `C:\Users\hotra\AppData\Local\synapse\build-target\synapse-a924ab647587\release\synapse-mcp.exe`

- Candidate tool count: `168`
- Candidate tool surface SHA256:
  `66b77726e99b527e78bc1b87e8bc6dec9a8f6ca995515a7c8a0c17d6ddeee06d`
- New daemon PID: `30904`
- Chrome bridge status after daemon start: `stale=false`,
  capability `pageScreenshot`
- Codex tool-surface snapshot written with tool count `168`

Chrome bridge setup was auto-verified during handoff:

- Transport: `direct_localhost_websocket`
- Extension ID: `leoocgnkjnplbfdbklajepahofecgfbk`
- Bridge build:
  `synapse-chrome-bridge-2026-06-24-mousedown-click-v3`

Same-process MCP readback from this existing Codex session after daemon restart:

- `mcp__synapse.health`: `ok=true`
- PID: `30904`
- Tool count: `168`
- Tool surface SHA256:
  `66b77726e99b527e78bc1b87e8bc6dec9a8f6ca995515a7c8a0c17d6ddeee06d`

- Visible tools include `routine_mine`, `routine_list`, `routine_inspect`,
  `routine_update`, `routine_label_export`, `episode_segment`, `episode_list`,
  `episode_get`, and `timeline_digest`.

Setup reported the current Codex process schema as stale but nonfatal, and the
same-process MCP calls above verified reconnect without opening a new Codex
terminal.

## Acceptance Mapping

- B1 Seed/replay multi-day timeline: PASS. The FSV inserted 22 marked timeline
  rows for a Monday-Friday planted routine plus realistic noise, and
  `timeline_search` returned all 22 rows by marker.
- B2 Segmentation: PASS. `episode_segment` produced 16 physical episodes across
  5 processed days, and `episode_list` returned 16.
- B3 Mining: PASS. `routine_mine` found exactly one routine with the expected
  `outlook.exe -> excel.exe -> teams.exe` sequence, weekday schedule,
  09:00+/-10m timing, 5/5 support, and honest confidence `0.5655175352168252`.
- B4 Query and lifecycle: PASS. `routine_list`, `routine_inspect`, and
  `routine_update` confirmed and renamed the mined routine with persistent
  transition readback.
- B5 Labeling: PASS. `routine_label_export` returned the renamed label, three
  samples, the machine identity containing all planted apps, and a
  `routine_update` writeback hint.
- B6 Digest accuracy: PASS. `timeline_digest` reconciled with ground truth:
  the single planted routine day reported `540000` active ms and three matched
  routine episodes; the planted week reported `3000000` active ms, 16 total
  episodes including the noise episode, and 15 matched routine evidence
  episodes.
- Reconnect guarantee: PASS. The shared daemon was rebuilt, restarted, Chrome
  bridge was auto-verified, and this same Codex process called
  `mcp__synapse.health` and `mcp__synapse.tool_profile_status` successfully
  after the restart.
