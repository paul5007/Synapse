# 02 — Perception Subsystem

## 1. What "perception" means

The perception subsystem turns live machine state into a structured `Observation` value the agent reads with low latency and low token cost.

Two paths, simultaneously active:

| Path | Source of truth | When primary |
|---|---|---|
| **A11y path** | Windows UI Automation tree, WinEvent push, Chromium DevTools Protocol | Foreground app exposes a usable accessibility tree (most native apps, browsers, IDEs, Office) |
| **Pixel path** | GPU frame capture + small CNN + targeted OCR + audio loopback | Foreground is a game, canvas-based app, or window where a11y is empty/insufficient |

`observe()` is the unified read. Both paths feed the same `Observation`; agent picks a query, not a path. The subsystem decides which sensors are cheapest and richest for the current foreground.

Output schemas: `06_data_schemas.md`.

---

## 2. Frame capture (`synapse-capture` crate)

### Strategy

Primary API: **Windows Graphics Capture API** via `windows-capture` crate v2.x. Fallback for older Windows / unsupported configs: **DXGI Output Duplication** via raw `windows-rs` bindings.

Both expose captured frames as `ID3D11Texture2D` in GPU memory. **NEVER copy the texture to system memory** unless an explicit caller (OCR, JPEG export, replay log) requires it. Detection inference runs on the texture directly via DirectML / CUDA.

### Capture targets

Per ADR-0005, each session has exactly one active capture target at a time.
The default is the primary monitor. Agents explicitly switch to another monitor
or window with `set_capture_target`; Synapse does not stitch the virtual desktop
or run concurrent per-monitor captures in M3.

| Target | Use |
|---|---|
| Primary monitor | Default; whole-desktop capture |
| Specific monitor by index | Multi-monitor setups; profile-selectable |
| Specific window by HWND | When agent calls `set_capture_target(window=...)`; reduces VRAM and CPU |

Per-target settings:

- `cursor_visible: bool` — render cursor into frame (default true)
- `secondary_windows: bool` — include child/popup windows (default true for window targets)
- `min_update_interval_ms` — frame-rate cap (default 16ms = 60fps; 33ms for 30fps when GPU-bound)
- `dirty_region_only: bool` — when true, perception skips processing if no dirty pixels (default true)

### Frame lifecycle

```rust
pub struct CapturedFrame {
    pub texture: SendablePtr<ID3D11Texture2D>,   // unsafe Send wrapper; consumer must scope correctly
    pub width: u32,
    pub height: u32,
    pub format: DxgiFormat,                      // typically B8G8R8A8_UNORM
    pub captured_at: Instant,
    pub frame_seq: u64,
    pub dirty_region: Option<Rect>,
}
```

Frames flow through bounded channel (capacity 2). If consumer can't keep up, oldest frame is dropped — NEVER block the capture thread. `frames_dropped` metric is incremented.

### Capture thread

One OS thread for the active capture target. Runs at
`THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL`. Communicates with tokio via
`crossbeam::channel::bounded(2)`.

```rust
loop {
    let frame = graphics_capture.wait_for_next_frame()?;       // blocks until vsync or 16ms tick
    if !frame.has_changes() && config.dirty_region_only {
        continue;
    }
    if tx.try_send(frame).is_err() {
        metrics.frames_dropped.inc();
    }
}
```

### Fallback path

If Graphics Capture API init fails (unsupported Windows build, no DWM), capture crate falls back to DXGI Output Duplication. Same `CapturedFrame` shape; capture rate may degrade to ~30fps on heavy desktops.

### VRAM and lifetime

- Max two textures resident per capture target (current + previous, for dirty diff).
- D3D resources released on shutdown via RAII (`Drop` impl on `CaptureHandle`).
- Capture continues while no one consumes, at min update interval; no VRAM growth.

---

## 3. Accessibility tree (`synapse-a11y` crate)

### Three subsystems

**3a. UIA tree walker.** Wraps `uiautomation` crate. Provides:

```rust
pub fn focused_window() -> Result<UIElement>;
pub fn focused_element() -> Result<UIElement>;
pub fn element_from_point(x: i32, y: i32) -> Result<UIElement>;
pub fn snapshot(element: &UIElement, depth: u32) -> Result<AccessibleSubtree>;
pub fn find(element: &UIElement, query: AccessibleQuery) -> Result<Vec<UIElement>>;
```

`AccessibleSubtree` is a serializable tree of `AccessibleNode`s with name, role/control-type, AutomationId, bounding rect, enabled, focused, pattern support (Invoke, Toggle, Value, Selection, ExpandCollapse, Scroll, Text), and a stable element id (Synapse-assigned; see `06_data_schemas.md`).

**Depth cap.** Default depth 2 around the focused element + 3 for a window snapshot. Cap is profile-overridable. UIA trees can be enormous (50K+ elements in Outlook); NEVER walk the whole tree without bound.

**Cache request batching.** When snapshotting >100 elements, use `IUIAutomationCacheRequest` to fetch all needed properties in a single cross-process COM round-trip. Per-element property fetch is ~1ms; cached batch fetch is ~10ms for hundreds.

**3b. WinEvent hook.** Win32 `SetWinEventHook` with COM apartment model. Subscribes to:

| Event | Fired when |
|---|---|
| `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND` | Foreground window changed |
| `EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS` | Focus moved (within or between windows) |
| `EVENT_OBJECT_VALUECHANGE` | Editable element value changed |
| `EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE` | Element name (title) changed |
| `EVENT_OBJECT_CREATE`, `EVENT_OBJECT_DESTROY` | Element appeared / disappeared |
| `EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTION`, `EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONADD`, `EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONREMOVE` | Selection changed |
| `EVENT_SYSTEM_MENUSTART`, `EVENT_SYSTEM_MENUEND` | Menu opened/closed |
| `EVENT_SYSTEM_ALERT` | Alert/error popup |

Hook callbacks run on COM apartment thread. Marshal events into `tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender<AccessibleEvent>` drained by perception.

**3c. CDP client.** Chrome DevTools Protocol via `chromiumoxide`. Activated when:

- Foreground process is a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Electron apps with debug port)
- Browser launched with `--remote-debugging-port=<N>` OR `chrome.devtools_protocol` reachable

Exposes:

- `DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot` — full DOM + computed styles + bounds
- `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` — semantic AX tree
- `DOM.querySelector` — CSS selector query
- `Page.captureScreenshot` — fallback when DOM is sparse (canvas-heavy pages)
- `Network.requestWillBeSent` — request stream
- `Console.messageAdded` — console messages

CDP overrides UIA for the affected browser tab when available; richer data, no AX-tree-flattening of Chromium's internal hierarchy.

### Event filter

Synapse coalesces high-frequency a11y events:

- Events sharing `(window_id, element_id, kind)` within a 50ms window merged into one `AccessibleEvent` with latest values
- `EVENT_OBJECT_VALUECHANGE` on an actively-typed text field is debounced to one event per 200ms (or on focus loss, whichever first)

---

## 4. Detection / inference (`synapse-perception::detect`)

When pixel-path perception is needed, run a small object detection model per captured frame.

### Model selection (default v1)

| Model | Size | Latency on RTX 3060 (DirectML) | Latency on RTX 5090 (CUDA) | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RT-DETRv2-S COCO ONNX | ~81 MB | ~25 ms @ 640px | ~5 ms @ 640px | Default per ADR-0010. License-safe general object detection. |
| YOLOv10n / YOLOv8n | ~6 MB | ~6 ms @ 640px | ~2 ms @ 640px | Operator-import only when the checkpoint is license-compliant and SHA-pinned. |
| YOLOv8s | ~22 MB | ~10 ms | ~3 ms | Optional import for higher accuracy when latency budget permits. |
| Florence-2-base (or similar) | ~480 MB | ~120 ms | ~25 ms | Slow loop only, ≤1 Hz, for unknown-game labeling |

**Selectable per profile.** Productivity profile (Notepad) disables detection
entirely. The Minecraft profile pins `rtdetr_v2_s_coco_onnx`. Future
Minecraft-specific fine-tuned detectors can override the profile model id when
they have license-clean artifacts and SHA-pinned registry rows.

### Inference path

```rust
trait Detector: Send + Sync {
    fn infer(&self, frame: &CapturedFrame, opts: DetectOpts) -> Result<DetectionBatch>;
}
```

Backend selection at startup, in priority order:
1. ONNX Runtime CUDA execution provider (NVIDIA only)
2. ONNX Runtime DirectML execution provider (any DX12 GPU)
3. ONNX Runtime CPU (degraded; only for small models in dev)

All via `ort` crate (Rust bindings to ONNX Runtime). One persistent inference session per loaded model. Reuse pinned input buffers.

### DetectionBatch

```rust
pub struct DetectionBatch {
    pub model_id: String,
    pub frame_seq: u64,
    pub inferred_at: Instant,
    pub items: Vec<Detection>,
}

pub struct Detection {
    pub class_label: String,       // from the model's class map
    pub bbox: Rect,                // pixel coords in capture frame
    pub confidence: f32,
    pub track_id: Option<u64>,     // assigned by simple IoU+name tracker
}
```

### Tracking

Lightweight tracker assigns persistent `track_id`s by IoU + class-name matching across consecutive frames. Track lifetime: a track without a detection for 1000ms is retired. Agent references stable `entity_id = track_id` in subsequent commands without re-querying every frame.

### Model cache

Models live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\synapse\models\`. The default registry entry
declares `rtdetr_v2_s_coco_onnx`, filename `rtdetr_v2_s_coco.onnx`, its
download URL, and SHA-256. The current runtime fails closed if a model is
missing; setup/import work must acquire the artifact through a license-compliant
local path and then verify SHA before load. NEVER load a model without
verification.

For offline use, operator side-loads: `synapse-mcp models import <path>`.

---

## 5. OCR

Two OCR backends ship at v1:

| Backend | Latency p99 (1080p text region) | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| WinRT `Windows.Media.Ocr` | ~30 ms full screen, ~5 ms small region | Default. No external dep, ships with Windows. Excellent for printed text in most languages. |
| Fine-tuned CRNN (ONNX) | ~10 ms small region, ~80 ms full screen | Game HUD numbers (HP / ammo / score) with unusual fonts; trained per-profile. |

WinRT path uses `windows-rs` bindings to `Windows.Media.Ocr.OcrEngine`. Region cropping on GPU texture; only marshal cropped region to system memory.

### Region targeting

Agent calls:

```
read_text(region={x,y,w,h}) -> { text, words: [{text, bbox, confidence}], language }
```

Default: read focused element's bounds (UIA-resolved) or, no a11y, full screen.

### HUD extraction

Per-game profile defines named HUD regions:

```toml
[hud.hp]
region = { x = 50, y = 980, w = 120, h = 30 }
extractor = "crnn"           # or "winrt"
preprocessing = ["threshold:128", "invert"]
```

Profile-driven extraction runs in `synapse-perception::hud`. Returns:

```rust
pub struct HudReadings {
    pub by_name: HashMap<String, HudReading>,    // e.g. "hp" -> 85
}
pub struct HudReading {
    pub raw_text: String,
    pub parsed: HudValue,   // Number | String | Enum
    pub confidence: f32,
    pub stale_ms: u32,      // how old this reading is
}
```

For icon counters such as Minecraft hearts and hunger, `synapse-perception`
exposes a slotted template extractor. It
takes a cropped grayscale HUD region plus full/half/empty templates and scans
each slot with zero-mean normalized cross-correlation. The default status-bar
config is 10 slots, full=2, half=1, empty=0, max value 20, and minimum
per-slot confidence 0.85. Synthetic 180x16 regions with three 9x9 templates
measure at roughly 0.29 ms locally, leaving the 5 ms HUD budget for capture and
future live-frame wiring.

### OCR cache

`CF_OCR_CACHE` keyed by `sha256(cropped_region_bytes)` → `OcrResult`. TTL 1h. Hit rate on stable HUDs (HP/ammo) is high; rebuilds drop from 30 ms to ~0.1 ms.

---

## 6. Audio (`synapse-audio` crate)

### Loopback capture

Uses the system-default audio render device through WASAPI loopback on Windows. The M3 MCP audio tools require `--enable-audio` / `SYNAPSE_ENABLE_AUDIO=true`; the runtime is initialized lazily when `audio_tail` or `audio_transcribe` needs it. When audio is enabled, loopback capture starts by default unless `SYNAPSE_AUDIO_LOOPBACK=0` / `false`. Buffers the last N seconds in a ring buffer; M3 supports 1-5 seconds and defaults to 5s.

```rust
pub struct AudioConfig {
    pub ring_seconds: u32,
    pub start_loopback: bool,
    pub detectors_enabled: bool,
    pub stt_model_path: Option<PathBuf>,
}

impl AudioRuntime {
    pub fn spawn(config: AudioConfig) -> AudioResult<Self>;
    pub fn tail_seconds(&self, seconds: f32) -> AudioResult<AudioWindow>;
    pub fn estimate_direction_tail(&self, seconds: f32) -> AudioResult<DirectionEstimate>;
    pub fn transcribe_tail(&self, seconds: f32, language: impl AsRef<str>) -> AudioResult<Transcription>;
    pub fn detector_snapshot(&self) -> DetectorSnapshot;
    pub fn loopback_status(&self) -> LoopbackStatus;
}

pub fn start_loopback(ring: Arc<AudioRing>, detectors: Option<DetectorProcessor>) -> AudioResult<LoopbackHandle>;
```

`AudioWindow` stores interleaved f32 samples with the active loopback format. The MCP `audio_tail` response converts the requested window to padded `s16le`, reports the sample rate and channel count, and returns an empty PCM buffer for `seconds = 0` without initializing the runtime.

### STT

Whisper-tiny-int8 ONNX is the pinned M3 model family. It runs on demand when the agent calls `audio_transcribe()`. The tool accepts only English (`"en"` or empty/default), transcribes the requested ring window, and returns `{ text, confidence, latency_ms, model_id: "whisper_tiny_int8" }`.

Continuous transcription and per-profile transcription flags are not live M3 behavior; adding them requires a later profile/runtime change.

### Spatial direction estimate

Naive method: compute interleaved L/R energy ratio + GCC-PHAT-style cross-correlation lag. Returns:

```rust
pub struct DirectionEstimate {
    pub azimuth_deg: f32,          // 0 = front, +90 = right, -90 = left
    pub confidence: f32,
}
```

Sufficient for FPS footstep direction at v1. Steam Audio (audionimbus crate) is the v2 upgrade for HRTF-accurate spatial localization.

### Audio events

When `detectors_enabled` is true, the loopback thread runs the current heuristic detector processor and publishes events to the event bus. M3 wires the MCP runtime with detectors disabled by default; detector state is still exposed through `detector_snapshot()` for runtime paths that enable it.

| Event | Trigger heuristic |
|---|---|
| `loud_transient` | RMS exceeds 5× moving average (gunshots, impacts) |
| `speech_started` | RMS crosses the speech start threshold |
| `speech_ended` | RMS stays below the speech end threshold for 500ms |
| `music_started` / `music_ended` | RMS plus crest-factor heuristic |

Events pushed to the event bus.

---

## 7. Event derivation

Both paths emit events:

| Event source | Examples |
|---|---|
| WinEvent | `focus_changed`, `window_opened`, `value_changed`, `selection_changed` |
| UIA structure | `element_appeared`, `element_disappeared` (computed by diffing snapshots) |
| CDP | `dom_mutation`, `navigation_committed`, `network_request_failed` |
| Detection | `entity_appeared` (new track), `entity_disappeared` (track timed out), `entity_class_changed` |
| HUD OCR | `hud_value_changed` (HP went from 100 → 85) |
| Audio | `loud_transient`, `speech_started`, `loud_transient_directional` |
| Filesystem | `file_created`, `file_changed`, `file_deleted` (via `notify` crate) |
| Process | `process_started`, `process_exited`, `socket_opened` |
| Clipboard | `clipboard_changed` |

All events normalized to `synapse-core::Event`:

```rust
pub struct Event {
    pub seq: u64,                    // monotonic across all sources
    pub at: SystemTime,
    pub source: EventSource,
    pub kind: EventKind,
    pub data: serde_json::Value,
    pub correlations: Vec<EventRef>, // e.g., "this hud_value_changed correlates with that entity_class_changed"
}
```

Full schema in `06_data_schemas.md`. Persistence in `CF_EVENTS` (`07_storage_and_profiles.md`).

Profile `event_extensions` are evaluated in `synapse-perception` after a real
event is produced. Each matching extension emits a new
`EventSource::Perception` event with `kind = emits_kind`, a correlation back to
the triggering event sequence, and compact readback data containing the
extension name and triggering event fields. Registration fails closed for
invalid filters or trivially always-true filters so a profile cannot turn every
incoming event into unbounded synthetic traffic.

---

## 8. The unified Observation

`observe()` returns this struct (JSON-serialized):

```rust
pub struct Observation {
    pub at: SystemTime,
    pub mode: PerceptionMode,                   // a11y_only | pixel_only | hybrid
    pub foreground: ForegroundContext,
    pub focused: Option<FocusedElement>,
    pub elements: Vec<AccessibleNode>,          // truncated by depth/N
    pub entities: Vec<DetectedEntity>,          // CNN detections with track ids
    pub hud: HudReadings,                       // game-only
    pub audio: AudioContext,                    // recent events + direction estimate if any
    pub recent_events: Vec<Event>,              // since last observe(), capped
    pub clipboard_summary: Option<ClipboardSummary>,
    pub fs_recent: Vec<FsEvent>,                // last 5 file changes
    pub diagnostics: ObservationDiagnostics,    // perception health (which sensors active, latencies)
}
```

Tokenization budget: aim for `serde_json::to_string(&observation)` ≤ 6 KB (≈ 1500 tokens) under typical conditions. Larger queries require explicit `expand(slot=...)` calls.

---

## 9. Perception mode auto-selection

```
on foreground change:
    profile = profiles::detect(hwnd)
    if profile.is_some():
        mode = profile.preferred_mode
    else:
        a11y_tree_size = a11y::snapshot(focused_window, depth=1).len()
        if a11y_tree_size > 5:
            mode = a11y_only
        else:
            mode = hybrid
    apply(mode):
        if a11y_only: stop pixel capture; keep UIA + WinEvent
        if pixel_only: stop UIA event handlers; keep capture + audio
        if hybrid: both
```

Profile-pinned mode wins over heuristics.

---

## 10. Health and degraded modes

| State | Meaning | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `healthy` | All requested sensors active and within latency budget | n/a |
| `degraded_latency` | One or more sensors exceeded latency budget recently | Auto-retry; surface in `diagnostics` |
| `degraded_sensor_failed` | A sensor crashed or returned errors persistently | Disable that sensor; surface in `diagnostics`; agent can `observe()` to see what's missing |
| `unavailable` | All sensors failed | Return `OBSERVE_NO_PERCEPTION_AVAILABLE` error from `observe()` |

Sensors recover independently. UIA failure does not stop pixel capture, and vice versa.

---

## 11. CPU / GPU budget

| Subsystem | Steady-state CPU | Steady-state GPU | VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capture (idle, no consumers) | ~0.1% | ~0% (texture shared with DWM) | ~10 MB |
| Capture (60 fps, consumer attached) | ~2% | ~2% | ~40 MB |
| Detection async loop (RT-DETRv2-S COCO) | ~5% | ~20% on RTX 5090 | ~350 MB |
| UIA event subscriber | ~1% | 0 | ~10 MB |
| Audio loopback + ring buffer | ~0.5% | 0 | ~5 MB |
| OCR (on demand, region) | spike to ~5% for ~5 ms | spike to ~10% | ~50 MB |

Total ceiling at v1: 10% CPU, 25% GPU, 1.5 GB VRAM when fully active. Idle: <2% CPU, <1% GPU, <500 MB VRAM.

---

## 12. Coordinate systems

| System | Origin | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| Screen (virtual desktop) | Top-left of the union of all monitors | Mouse moves, top-level rect math |
| Monitor (per-monitor) | Top-left of one monitor | Per-target capture coords |
| Window client | Top-left of a specific window's client area | A11y bounding rects when window-relative |
| Capture frame | Top-left of captured texture | Detection bboxes |

DPI: all coordinates use **physical pixels** (per-monitor-aware v2 DPI scaling). Synapse calls `SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext(DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2)` at startup.

Transforms exposed:

```rust
pub fn screen_to_window(screen: Point, hwnd: HWND) -> Point;
pub fn window_to_screen(window: Point, hwnd: HWND) -> Point;
pub fn frame_to_screen(frame: Point, target: &CaptureTarget) -> Point;
```

All bounding rects in `Observation` are screen coordinates unless explicitly tagged.

---

## 13. Failure surfaces

| Failure | Error code | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Graphics Capture unsupported | `CAPTURE_GRAPHICS_API_UNSUPPORTED` | Fall back to DXGI Output Duplication |
| Capture target HWND no longer valid | `CAPTURE_TARGET_LOST` | Surface to caller; agent picks a new target |
| UIA returned a stale element | `A11Y_ELEMENT_STALE` | Re-snapshot the parent |
| Detection model not loaded | `DETECTION_MODEL_NOT_LOADED` | Surface to caller; either operator imports model or perception runs without detection |
| OCR failed (no text found) | `OCR_NO_TEXT` | Not an error from agent's perspective; observation returns empty text |
| Audio device disconnected | `AUDIO_DEVICE_LOST` | Re-enumerate devices; resume on next default device |
| Per-app profile not found | `PROFILE_NOT_FOUND` | Use hybrid default |

Every error code exported as `pub const` in `synapse-core::error_codes`.
