# 05 — MCP Tool Surface

## 1. Design rules

1. **Tool count cap:** M3 shipped 30 live MCP tools. M4 expands the target
   surface to 33 live MCP tools by adding `act_combo`, `act_run_shell`, and
   `act_launch` per the M4 phase plan. M5 adds the local registry/audit scoring
   tool `profile_quality_refresh` plus the #458 local registry/intelligence
   tool set, #460 adds local audit-export consent/bundle tools, and #462 adds
   six local profile-authoring candidate tools, and #468 adds the read-only
   registry/audit inspector, #499 adds a profile-keymap action alias tool,
   #508 adds the narrow EverQuest `/loc` probe, #524 adds the visible
   EverQuest chat-input pollution readback/gate, #510 adds the compact
   EverQuest current-state estimator, #526 adds compact EverQuest outcome
   ingest, #528 adds EverQuest hazard/safe memory record and consult tools,
   #527 adds EverQuest route-plan rows, #525 adds EverQuest current-map sensor
   rows, #514 adds EverQuest planner guard-decision rows, #511 adds the
   EverQuest DynamicJEPA domain normalizer, #512 adds linked trajectory rows
   from action/observation/event/log evidence, #521 adds the
   ContextGraph-compatible DynamicJEPA episode exporter, #529 adds
   ContextGraph ingestion/search bridge tools for exported EverQuest memories,
   #513 adds EverQuest
   world-model record/inspect storage surfaces, #515 adds the EverQuest
   surprise detector row writer, #516 adds the compact EverQuest world-summary
   context row writer, #531 adds EverQuest action-prior sample/scorecard
   tools, #522 adds transparent EverQuest predictive-model fit/predict rows,
   #535 adds the narrow EverQuest safe slash-command plus survival readiness
   row surfaces, and #538 adds the delta-first reality baseline/delta/audit
   tools, bringing the live surface to 79. Any
   further agent-facing tools require an ADR-approved cap change.
   Overlapping tools merge. Profile and parameter knobs are the escape hatches.
2. **One tool, one verb.** No `do_everything(action_kind, ...)` mega-tools.
3. **Structured input, structured output.** Every tool defines a JSON Schema with `additionalProperties: false`. Every response carries explicit fields, no free-form text.
4. **No silent success.** If a tool did not do the work, it returns an MCP error with `code: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, never `success: true` with a partial result.
5. **All async; all cancellable.** Long-running tools support progress notifications via Streamable HTTP SSE upgrade.
6. **Idempotency tokens where it matters.** `act_run_shell`, `act_launch`, and similar accept an optional `idempotency_key` for safe retries.
7. **Stable identifiers.** `element_id`, `entity_id`, `track_id`, `reflex_id`, `session_id` are returned by tools and accepted unchanged by subsequent calls. Agent never invents these.
8. **Delta-first reality.** Per #536, full observations establish or repair a
   baseline; routine context should be ordered reality deltas, with periodic
   full audits to detect drift and force rebase. #537 defines the canonical
   schemas and #538 exposes the live MCP baseline/delta/audit tools. Manual SoT
   readback remains mandatory because tool returns are attempt evidence only.
9. **Clipboard is metadata only.** When an MCP request includes the `clipboard`
   slot, live observation/reality tools may read the system clipboard only to
   populate redacted summary metadata: formats, optional text length, and a
   hash-only excerpt marker. Raw clipboard text must not be stored in reality
   rows.
10. **Audio summaries are metadata only.** When an MCP request includes the
    `audio` slot and audio is enabled, live observation/reality tools may sample
    loopback only to populate bounded RMS, VAD, detector-event, and direction
    metadata. Raw PCM and transcript text must not be stored in observation or
    reality rows.
11. **Filesystem paths are hash-only.** When an MCP request includes the `fs`
    slot, live observation/reality tools read only the explicitly configured
    non-recursive `SYNAPSE_FS_WATCH_ROOT` watcher. Events are capped and store
    hashed path tokens, event kind, and optional file size metadata; raw watched
    paths must not be stored in observation or reality rows.

The first 30 tools below are the live M3 baseline. #499 adds `act_keymap` as a
profile-keymap action alias, #508 adds `everquest_loc_probe` as a literal
EverQuest `/loc` readback tool, #535 adds `everquest_safe_command` for
allowlisted non-social survival slash commands and
`everquest_survival_readiness` for read-only blocker rows, #524 adds
`everquest_chat_input_state` as the visible chat-buffer pollution readback that
also gates `/loc` and the safe command tool, #510 adds
`everquest_current_state` as the compact world-state row writer/readback tool, #526 adds
`everquest_outcome_ingest`, #528 adds `everquest_memory_record` plus
`everquest_memory_consult`, #514 adds `everquest_planner_guard`, #527 adds
`everquest_route_plan`, #525 adds `everquest_map_sensor`, #511 adds
`everquest_domain_normalize`, #512 adds `everquest_trajectory_record`, #521 adds
`everquest_episode_export`, #529 adds `everquest_contextgraph_ingest` plus
`everquest_contextgraph_search`, #513 adds `everquest_world_model_record` plus
`everquest_world_model_inspect`, #515 adds `everquest_surprise_detect`, #516 adds
`everquest_world_summary`, #522 adds `everquest_predictive_model_fit` plus
`everquest_predictive_model_predict`, and #531 adds
`everquest_action_prior_record` plus `everquest_action_prior_scorecard`. #538
adds `reality_baseline`, `observe_delta`, and `reality_audit`. M4 adds
`act_combo`, `act_run_shell`, and `act_launch`; M5 adds local
profile-registry/audit quality scoring, authoring candidates, registry row
operations, import/export, audit intelligence, and consented redacted audit
export bundles.
Schemas use abbreviated JSON Schema syntax; canonical schema is exported by the
daemon through standard MCP `tools/list`.

## 3. Tool detail

### 3.1 `observe`

Returns current unified perception observation.

```json
{
  "name": "observe",
  "description": "Returns structured state of the focused window and surrounding context. Replaces screenshots for most use cases.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "include": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {"enum": ["focused", "elements", "entities", "hud", "audio", "events", "clipboard", "fs", "diagnostics"]},
        "description": "Which slots to populate. Defaults to ['focused','elements','entities','hud','events']"
      },
      "depth": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 6, "default": 2},
      "max_elements": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 500, "default": 60},
      "since_event_seq": {"type": "integer", "description": "If set, recent_events filtered to events with seq > this"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns `Observation` (see `06_data_schemas.md`). Typical size 1–6 KB.

Errors: `OBSERVE_NO_PERCEPTION_AVAILABLE` (all sensors down), `OBSERVE_INTERNAL`.

### 3.1a `reality_baseline`, `observe_delta`, `reality_audit` (live, #536/#538)

These are the live delta-first reality surfaces registered by
`server/reality.rs` and counted in the live 79-tool surface.

- `reality_baseline` captures or reads a compact baseline for the current
  profile/session. It persists `CF_KV/reality/baseline/v1/<profile>/<epoch>`
  plus `CF_KV/reality/head/v1/<profile>` and returns epoch, baseline seq,
  physical source refs, baseline hash, row readbacks, and token/size counters.
- `observe_delta` returns ordered `RealityDelta` records since a cursor or
  epoch. Empty changes return an explicit `no_changes` result with the current
  cursor; changed reality persists `CF_KV/reality/delta/v1/<profile>/<epoch>/<seq>`
  rows, updates the head row, and publishes `reality_delta` SSE events.
  The compact comparison now emits stable-path, field-level deltas for
  foreground/focus, UIA element appear/disappear/name/bounds changes, HUD
  values and errors, entity appear/disappear/move/class/confidence changes,
  audio summaries, log/runtime action outcomes, clipboard summaries,
  filesystem summaries, and diagnostics.
  High-fanout UIA element changes coalesce at eight or more affected elements:
  appeared/disappeared fanout becomes one bounded `uia_structure_changed`
  delta, and reused-element field fanout becomes one bounded
  `uia_elements_changed` delta. Both use `/elements` with counts, capped
  changed IDs, and compact hashes; low-fanout element changes stay as
  individual element or field deltas.
  Each delta scopes `source_refs` to the changed physical surface so high-fanout
  UIA changes do not repeat unrelated observation refs on every row.
  If a coalesced UIA batch is still larger than the compact snapshot budget,
  `observe_delta` returns `delta_snapshot_budget_exceeded` rebase guidance
  before writing bloated delta rows.
  Missing baselines, stale epochs, profile changes, and overflowed cursors
  return explicit rebase guidance; invalid future `since_seq` fails closed.
- `reality_audit` re-reads physical SoTs, compares them against the
  baseline+delta assumption, persists
  `CF_KV/reality/audit/v1/<profile>/<audit_id>`, and returns drift status plus
  rebase guidance.

Manual FSV for these tools must prove live `synapse-mcp`, call the real MCP
tool, and separately inspect the physical UI/log/file/process/storage/device
SoTs plus persisted `CF_KV/reality/*` rows. Tool returns are not the verdict.

### 3.2 `find`

Semantic search over visible elements and entities.

```json
{
  "name": "find",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["query"],
    "properties": {
      "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Free-text query, e.g., 'save button' or 'the red enemy'"},
      "scope": {"enum": ["elements", "entities", "both"], "default": "both"},
      "limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 20, "default": 5},
      "in_window": {"type": "string", "description": "Optional element_id of a window to restrict to"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "kind": "element",
      "element_id": "...",
      "name": "Save",
      "role": "Button",
      "automation_id": "btnSave",
      "bbox": {"x": 100, "y": 200, "w": 80, "h": 32},
      "score": 0.93
    },
    {
      "kind": "entity",
      "entity_id": "track:42",
      "class_label": "enemy",
      "bbox": {"x": 820, "y": 340, "w": 60, "h": 130},
      "score": 0.87
    }
  ]
}
```

Implementation: combines string similarity against UIA names/automation IDs and detection class labels with a small bias for foreground-window scope.

### 3.3 `describe` (deferred, not live M3)

Slow-path natural-language description via small VLM. Used for first-orientation on unknown games or when a11y + detection produce sparse results.

```json
{
  "name": "describe",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "region": {"type": "object", "properties": {"x":{}, "y":{}, "w":{}, "h":{}}, "description": "Region in screen coordinates; default full focused window"},
      "detail": {"enum": ["coarse", "standard", "detailed"], "default": "standard"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "description": "...",
  "model_id": "florence2-base",
  "latency_ms": 230
}
```

Latency 100–500 ms. Use sparingly; default to `observe` + `find` first.

### 3.4 `read_text`

OCR a region.

```json
{
  "name": "read_text",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "region": {"type": "object", "properties": {"x":{}, "y":{}, "w":{}, "h":{}}},
      "element_id": {"type": "string", "description": "Alternative to region: OCR an a11y element's bounding rect"},
      "backend": {"enum": ["winrt", "crnn", "auto"], "default": "auto"},
      "lang_hint": {"type": "string", "description": "BCP-47 language tag, e.g., 'en-US'"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "full_text": "...",
  "words": [{"text": "Save", "bbox": {}, "confidence": 0.99}],
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "region": {"x": 10, "y": 20, "w": 120, "h": 32},
  "lang": "en"
}
```

Pre-v1 OCR cache/tool payloads using `text` / `language` / `backend` are wipe-and-rebuild;
the M3 response shape does not carry a compatibility shim.

### 3.5 `read_hud` (deferred, not live M3)

Read named HUD regions defined by the active profile.

```json
{
  "name": "read_hud",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "fields": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Subset of HUD field names; default all"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "readings": {
    "hp": {"value": 85, "raw_text": "85/100", "confidence": 0.98, "stale_ms": 16},
    "ammo": {"value": 12, "raw_text": "12", "confidence": 0.99, "stale_ms": 16}
  }
}
```

Errors: `HUD_NO_ACTIVE_PROFILE`, `HUD_FIELD_NOT_DEFINED`.

### 3.6 `audio_tail`

Returns summary of recent audio events.

```json
{
  "name": "audio_tail",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "seconds": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.1, "maximum": 30, "default": 5},
      "include_raw_waveform": {"type": "boolean", "default": false}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {"at": "...", "kind": "loud_transient", "azimuth_deg": 47, "confidence": 0.8}
  ],
  "rms_db": -22.5,
  "vad_speech_pct": 0.0,
  "waveform_b64": null
}
```

### 3.7 `audio_transcribe`

Speech-to-text on the recent audio window.

```json
{
  "name": "audio_transcribe",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "seconds": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.1, "maximum": 30, "default": 10},
      "lang_hint": {"type": "string", "default": "en"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{"text": "...", "segments": [{"start_s": 0, "end_s": 1.2, "text": "..."}], "model_id": "whisper-tiny-int8"}
```

### 3.8 `subscribe`

Opens a push stream (SSE) of filtered events. Returns immediately with `subscription_id`; events arrive as MCP notifications.
Per ADR-0007, Synapse emits one notification per event and does not batch at
the EventBus or SSE layer.

```json
{
  "name": "subscribe",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "filter": {"$ref": "#/$defs/EventFilter"},
      "snapshot_first": {"type": "boolean", "default": true, "description": "If true, push current Observation before live events"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{"subscription_id": "...", "snapshot_observation_seq": 12345}
```

Push events arrive as JSON-RPC notifications with method `synapse/event` and
params containing one `Event` value.

To cancel: `mcp/cancelled` JSON-RPC notification with original request id. Also exposes `subscribe_cancel(subscription_id)` for explicit teardown.

### 3.9 `set_capture_target`

Reconfigures active capture target.

Per ADR-0005, there is one active capture target per session. Monitor targets
are selected explicitly by index; Synapse does not stitch the virtual desktop or
capture multiple monitors concurrently in M3.

```json
{
  "name": "set_capture_target",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "target": {
        "oneOf": [
          {"type": "object", "required": ["kind"], "properties": {"kind": {"const": "primary"}}},
          {"type": "object", "required": ["kind", "monitor_index"], "properties": {"kind": {"const": "monitor"}, "monitor_index": {"type": "integer"}}},

```

### 3.10 `set_perception_mode`

```json
{
  "name": "set_perception_mode",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["mode"],
    "properties": {
      "mode": {"enum": ["a11y_only", "pixel_only", "hybrid", "auto"]}
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.11 `act_click`

```json
{
  "name": "act_click",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "target": {
        "oneOf": [
          {"type": "object", "required": ["element_id"], "properties": {"element_id": {"type": "string"}}},
          {"type": "object", "required": ["x","y"], "properties": {"x": {"type": "integer"}, "y": {"type": "integer"}}}
        ]
      },
      "button": {"enum": ["left", "right", "middle", "x1", "x2"], "default": "left"},
      "clicks": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 3, "default": 1},
      "modifiers": {"type": "array", "items": {"enum": ["ctrl","shift","alt","super"]}},
      "curve": {"$ref": "#/$defs/AimCurve", "default": "EaseInOut"},

      "backend": {"enum": ["software","vigem","hardware","auto"], "default": "auto"},
      "use_invoke_pattern": {"type": "boolean", "default": true, "description": "When target is an element_id with Invoke support, use semantic invoke (no cursor move)"}
    },
    "required": ["target"]
  }
}
```

Coordinate targets (`x`, `y`) are physical pixels (DPI-aware), matching UI Automation bounding boxes and per-monitor-DPI-aware `GetCursorPos`; see [03_action.md §13](03_action.md#13-click-on-element-semantics).

### 3.12 `act_type`

```json
{
  "name": "act_type",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["text"],
    "properties": {
      "text": {"type": "string"},
      "into_element": {"type": "string", "description": "Optional element_id; focuses + clears + types"},
      "dynamics": {"enum": ["burst","linear","natural"], "default": "natural"},
      "linear_ms_per_char": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 20, "default": 30, "description": "Applies to dynamics=linear; lower values fail closed because target text integrity must be verified at the app/file SoT"},
      "use_scancodes": {"type": "boolean", "default": false},
      "press_enter_after": {"type": "boolean", "default": false},
      "backend": {"enum": ["software","hardware","auto"], "default": "auto"}
    }
  },
  "output_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "ok": {"type": "boolean"},
      "chars_typed": {"type": "integer"},
      "elapsed_ms": {"type": "integer"},
      "target_text_integrity": {"const": "dispatch_only_requires_target_readback"},
      "target_readback_required": {"const": true},
      "minimum_linear_ms_per_char": {"const": 20}
    },
    "required": ["ok", "chars_typed", "elapsed_ms", "target_text_integrity", "target_readback_required", "minimum_linear_ms_per_char"]
  }
}
```

`act_type` success means Synapse dispatched the requested text events. It is not
proof that the foreground application accepted every character. Manual FSV for
text entry must read the target source of truth after the trigger, such as the
UI selection/clipboard readback plus a saved file/database row where the app
persists content. For `dynamics=linear`, `linear_ms_per_char < 20` is rejected
with `TOOL_PARAMS_INVALID` and reason
`linear_ms_per_char_below_text_integrity_minimum`; the `CF_ACTION_LOG` row keeps
that reason and the readback requirement visible.

### 3.13 `act_press`

```json
{
  "name": "act_press",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["keys"],
    "properties": {
      "keys": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Key names; multiple = chord (e.g., ['ctrl','s'])"},
      "hold_ms": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 30000, "default": 33},
      "backend": {"enum": ["software","hardware","auto"], "default": "auto"}
    }
  }
}
```

Key name vocabulary: standard symbolic names (`a`..`z`, `0`..`9`, `f1`..`f24`, `up`, `down`, `enter`, `space`, `tab`, `esc`, `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `super`, `lmb`, `rmb`, `mmb`, etc.). Per-game profile may extend (e.g., `medkit` → bound to whatever key is configured in that game).

For foreground-only live profiles, `act_press` writes a `details.preflight`
block into the action audit started row before dispatch. For `everquest.live`
that block proves the active profile before the check, the before/after
foreground HWND/process/path/title, whether the tool had to refocus
`eqgame.exe`, whether the HWND was minimized, and the final preflight status.
Missing, minimized-after-refocus, or mismatched EverQuest foreground fails
closed before input is emitted.

### 3.13a `act_keymap`

```json
{
  "name": "act_keymap",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["alias"],
    "properties": {
      "alias": {"type": "string", "description": "Profile keymap alias such as inventory, target_nearest_npc, con, menu, or hotbar1"},
      "hold_ms": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 30000, "default": 33},
      "backend": {"enum": ["software","hardware","auto"], "default": "auto"}
    }
  }
}
```

`act_keymap` resolves `alias` through the active profile's `[keymap]` table,
then lowers the reviewed binding to the same foreground-gated keyboard path as
`act_press`. The action audit rows must preserve the requested alias and the
resolved binding/key list so manual FSV can read both the command intent and
the physical input that was emitted. Unknown aliases, empty aliases, invalid
bindings, unsupported foreground, and excessive holds fail closed and still
write policy/error audit rows when the action gate is reached.

The started row also includes the same `details.preflight` proof as `act_press`.
For EverQuest manual FSV, denied non-EQ foreground rows must be treated as
non-progress; only an ok row with verified `eqgame.exe` preflight plus a
separate game/log/storage readback can support an action-effect claim.

### 3.13b `everquest_loc_probe`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_loc_probe",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

`everquest_loc_probe` is deliberately not a general chat or command surface. It
accepts no command text or parameters, emits only the literal `/loc` key
sequence for the active `everquest.live` foreground profile only after the
visible chat input pollution gate reads `text_present=false`, then tails the
physical EverQuest log from the pre-trigger byte offset. Success requires a
new `Your Location is Y, X, Z` line, `you_say_count=0`, and the pre-dispatch
`chat_input_state` readback; otherwise the tool fails closed and writes the
deny/error row to `CF_ACTION_LOG`.

Manual FSV must read the EQ log path, byte offset, location count, and `You
say` count before and after the trigger; read the visible chat input OCR crop
and `UI_<character>_<server>_<class>.ini` `MainChat` section; plus read the
`CF_ACTION_LOG` started/ok or denied rows through `storage_inspect` or an
audit readback. Disabled logging, non-EQ foreground, visible unsent chat text,
untrusted chat state, unknown parameters, malformed or absent location output,
and any player-say output are failure cases, not fallbacks.

### 3.13b0 `everquest_safe_command`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_safe_command",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["command"],
    "properties": {
      "command": {"enum": ["sit_on", "sit_off", "stand"]}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_safe_command` is a narrow survival/readiness tool, not a general
chat or command surface. It emits only one allowlisted literal slash command
for the active `everquest.live` foreground profile after the same visible chat
input pollution gate used by `everquest_loc_probe`: `/sit on`, `/sit off`, or
`/stand`. It then tails the physical EverQuest log from the pre-trigger byte
offset and succeeds only when no `You say` line appears. The response returns
the literal command, EQ log byte offsets, bounded compact event summaries,
`you_say_count`, and the pre-dispatch `chat_input_state` readback.

Manual FSV must still read the visible UI after the command. For rest/readiness
work, the SoT is the Inventory/Player-window HP/mana/posture readback plus the
EQ log tail and `CF_ACTION_LOG` rows. This tool must not be extended to social,
economy, merchant, chat, group, guild, PvP, account, or destructive commands
without a separate issue and explicit operator approval.

### 3.13b0a `everquest_survival_readiness`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_survival_readiness",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

`everquest_survival_readiness` is read-only. It sends no input and writes a
single compact row to
`CF_KV/everquest/survival_readiness/v1/everquest.live/latest`. The row fuses
foreground/profile state, `everquest.chat_input_state`, visible HUD resource
text (`HP/Mana` pairs when readable), and the physical EQ log tail. Resource
OCR accepts normal slash pairs such as `28/28` and the observed slash-loss form
where the separator is read as `1`, such as `28128` for `28/28`. It detects
food/drink absence from the authoritative log signal `You are out of food and
drink` without persisting raw chat bodies, and records hunger/thirst timestamps
as compact booleans/timestamps. Casting posture can be proven by recent
physical spell-cast log signals such as `You begin casting ...` or
`Your <spell> spell fizzles!`; those own-player signals are stored only as
compact cast/posture summaries and timestamps.

This row is a readiness verdict, not an action surface. It can prove current
blockers such as `mana_below_combat_floor`, `food_drink_absent`,
`hud_hp_mana_unavailable`, or `standing_posture_not_proven_for_casting`.
Merchant/economy/item acquisition remains disallowed unless a later issue has
explicit operator approval and its own manual FSV.

### 3.13b1 `everquest_chat_input_state`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_chat_input_state",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

`everquest_chat_input_state` reads the foreground EverQuest window, active
character UI layout file, and every `[MainChat]` coordinate mode (`Windowed`,
resolution-specific, and scaled resolution-specific candidates). It selects
only a candidate with visible WinRT OCR proof, then OCRs the bottom chat input
strip derived from that visible layout. It returns compact row-kind
`everquest.chat_input_state` with `visible`, `text_present`, `confidence`,
`decision`, optional `denial_reason`, `source_region`, foreground proof, layout
file SHA-256/line refs, OCR status/confidence, and source refs. It does not
persist or return raw chat text.

Manual FSV must read the physical UI layout file and visible OCR crop before
calling the real MCP tool, then separately inspect the same crop/layout state.
Edge reads must include visible unsent text, missing or low-confidence OCR or
invisible region, and layout/foreground disagreement. Text-like EverQuest tools
must fail closed unless this state is visible, trusted, and `text_present=false`.

### 3.13c `everquest_current_state`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_current_state",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

`everquest_current_state` estimates the compact live EverQuest state without
sending gameplay input. It reads the active foreground/profile and HUD fields,
the physical EverQuest log tail, recent `/loc` and zone events, local
`maps/*.txt` landmarks, and the latest EverQuest-linked Synapse action-audit rows. It then
writes the current snapshot to `CF_KV` key
`everquest/current_state/v1/everquest.live` and immediately reads that same row
back before returning.

The response includes confidence-scored fields for foreground focus,
character/server, log cursor, zone, zone short name, map-order location,
nearest landmarks, visible level, target/consider, latest action summaries, and
hazards. Unknown parameters fail with `TOOL_PARAMS_INVALID`. Missing active EQ
log state, disabled logging, storage write/read failure, or malformed map/log
state fail closed or lower confidence with explicit hazards rather than
inventing coordinates or levels.

Manual FSV must read the physical EQ log/config/map files and foreground state
before the trigger, call the real MCP tool, then separately read the
`CF_KV/everquest/current_state/v1/everquest.live` row through storage readback.
The returned row readback is useful evidence, but it does not replace the
separate source-of-truth read after the trigger.

### 3.13d `everquest_map_sensor`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_map_sensor",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["sensor_id"],
    "properties": {
      "sensor_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "state_row_key": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest/current_state/v1/everquest.live"},
      "state_override": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false},
      "visible_map_override": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false},
      "expected_zone_short_name": {"type": "string"},
      "stale_after_seconds": {"type": "integer", "default": 300},
      "max_nearest_labels": {"type": "integer", "default": 8}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_map_sensor` reads the persisted current-state row by default, fuses
visible map evidence from either the bounded `everquest.map_window_text` HUD
OCR crop for the saved top-left map-window layout or an explicit
observe/screenshot readback, reads the local map file and zone graph, writes
`CF_KV/everquest/map_sensor/v1/everquest.live/<sensor_id>`, and reads the exact
row back. Calibrated rows include foreground identity, visible map bounds,
current `/loc`, map file SHA-256/mtime/counts, nearest labels and exits,
visible label or player-marker anchors, compact readable map UI summary,
transform confidence, hazards, and source refs. The tool does not execute
movement.

Hidden maps, occlusion, stale current state, missing `/loc`, non-EQ foreground,
zoom/pan changes after calibration, low visible confidence, or contradictory
zone sources produce persisted fail-closed rows instead of guessed calibration.
Manual FSV must read the physical screenshot/observe crop, EQ log/current-state
row, and local map file before the trigger, call this real MCP tool, then
separately inspect the `CF_OBSERVATIONS`, `CF_EVENTS`, and `CF_KV` rows
afterward. Event rows include bounded HUD field-name/count metadata, not raw
OCR text.

### 3.13e `everquest_outcome_ingest`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_outcome_ingest",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "start_offset": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0},
      "max_bytes": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "default": 65536},
      "max_events": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "default": 64},
      "log_path": {"type": "string"},
      "allow_explicit_log_path": {"type": "boolean", "default": false},
      "persist_unknown": {"type": "boolean", "default": true}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_outcome_ingest` reads bounded EverQuest log bytes from the active
`everquest.live` log or an explicitly approved `eqlog_<character>_<server>.txt`
path, parses compact outcome events, and writes deterministic rows under
`CF_KV/everquest/outcome_event/v1/everquest.live/<offset>-<hash>`. Rows include
source path, byte offsets, line index in the read window, timestamp text, parsed
timestamp where available, SHA-256 of the source line, compact outcome kind,
confidence, and redaction evidence.

The compact taxonomy covers combat damage dealt/taken, spell begin/hit/fizzle
or resist, XP/level, death/respawn, loot, rest/sit, target/consider,
zone/location, hazard signals, chat-redacted lines, ambiguous combat, and
explicit timestamp diagnostics. Raw chat bodies are never persisted.

Manual FSV must read the physical log bytes before the trigger, call this real
MCP tool, then separately read `CF_KV` through storage readback and verify the
row offsets, hashes, kinds, and redaction flags.

### 3.13f `everquest_memory_record`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_memory_record",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["memory_id", "memory_type", "memory_kind", "subject", "confidence"],
    "properties": {
      "memory_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "memory_type": {"enum": ["hazard", "safe_area"]},
      "memory_kind": {"type": "string"},
      "subject": {"type": "string"},
      "zone_short_name": {"type": "string"},
      "location": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false},
      "radius": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.0},
      "severity": {"type": "string"},
      "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.0, "maximum": 1.0},
      "evidence_relation": {"enum": ["supports_memory", "conflicts_with_memory"], "default": "supports_memory"},
      "conflict_confidence_delta": {"type": "number", "default": 0.35},
      "source_state_row_key": {"type": "string"},
      "source_state_generated_at": {"type": "string"},
      "stale_after_seconds": {"type": "integer", "default": 3600},
      "source_refs": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}},
      "redacted_note": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_memory_record` writes either
`CF_KV/everquest/hazard_memory/v1/everquest.live/<memory_id>` or
`CF_KV/everquest/safe_area_memory/v1/everquest.live/<memory_id>`. Rows include
schema version, memory kind, subject, optional zone/location/radius, confidence,
active-for-planning status, source refs, redaction evidence, duplicate marker,
stale-source detection, and conflict downgrade state. Conflicting later
evidence lowers confidence instead of erasing the earlier hazard. Stale source
state caps confidence and prevents planner use until refreshed.

Manual FSV must read the physical source evidence before the trigger, call this
real MCP tool with known source refs, then separately inspect the durable
`CF_KV` row afterward. The schema is closed; attempted raw chat payload fields
are rejected and must leave storage unchanged.

### 3.13g `everquest_memory_consult`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_memory_consult",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["candidate_id", "candidate_kind"],
    "properties": {
      "candidate_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "candidate_kind": {"type": "string"},
      "target": {"type": "string"},
      "zone_short_name": {"type": "string"},
      "location": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false},
      "memory_row_keys": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "default": []},
      "max_memory_rows": {"type": "integer", "default": 128}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_memory_consult` reads named memory rows or scans the hazard/safe
prefixes, matches active rows against target, zone, and location radius, writes
`CF_KV/everquest/planner_consult/v1/everquest.live/<candidate_id>`, and reads
that exact decision row back. Matching active hazards return `avoid`; matching
safe areas without hazards return `allow_with_safe_memory`; candidates with no
target, zone, or location return `abstain_state_unknown`.

### 3.13h `everquest_planner_guard`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_planner_guard",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["decision_id", "candidate_kind"],
    "properties": {
      "decision_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "candidate_kind": {"enum": ["loc_probe", "inventory_read", "map_read", "target_consider", "bounded_move", "sit_rest", "combat_spell"]},
      "candidate_label": {"type": "string"},
      "hotbar_alias": {"type": "string"},
      "target_name": {"type": "string"},
      "target_level": {"type": "integer"},
      "target_con_summary": {"type": "string"},
      "combat_readiness": {
        "type": "object",
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "properties": {
          "health_percent": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 100},
          "mana_percent": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 100},
          "is_sitting": {"type": "boolean"},
          "rest_state": {"type": "string"},
          "confidence": {"type": "number", "default": 0.0},
          "source_summary": {"type": "string"}
        }
      },
      "state_row_key": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest/current_state/v1/everquest.live"},
      "state_override": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false},
      "chat_input_override": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_planner_guard` evaluates one candidate action before it can become
foreground input. It reads the live foreground process/profile, reads the
visible chat-input pollution state, reads the persisted current-state row by
default, writes
`CF_KV/everquest/planner_guard_decision/v1/everquest.live/<decision_id>`, and
reads the exact row back. Selected rows require `eqgame.exe` plus
`everquest.live`, empty visible chat input, a current-state row, known zone, and
candidate-specific guards. `combat_spell` is only selected for verified
`hotbar4` Blast of Cold, known NPC targets, level-1-safe target levels,
known non-gamble con text, and explicit health/mana/rest readiness evidence.
If health, mana, or casting posture is unknown or low confidence, combat
candidates reject before input.

Rejected rows preserve every failed guard name and reason. The tool never
executes input; movement/combat FSV must read this row before sending a bounded
action and then separately inspect the physical EQ UI/log/storage SoT after the
action.

### 3.13i `everquest_route_plan`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_route_plan",
  "input_schema": {

```

`everquest_route_plan` reads the persisted current-state row by default, builds
the local EverQuest map/zone graph from the configured install root, resolves a
target label or zone-line in the current zone, writes
`CF_KV/everquest/route_plan/v1/everquest.live/<plan_id>`, and reads the exact
route-plan row back. A ready plan contains current and target waypoints, map
coordinates, distance, nearest labels, confidence, source refs, and guard
requirements. The tool never executes movement; it emits bounded step-probe
requirements for later attended action FSV. Floor-route guidance prunes already
reached local map-line nodes before emitting the next waypoint so route rows do
not steer back to a crossed guidance point.

Before falling back to map labels, `everquest_route_plan` scans compact
`everquest/transition/v1/everquest.live/*` world-model rows. A row is eligible
only when it is a compact/redacted `transition` row with
`verification_status="verified_zone_entry"`, matching from/to zones, complete
`pre_zone_location` and `post_zone_location`, and confidence at least `0.70`.
Eligible rows become `verified_transition_volume` waypoints and are copied into
the route row as `verified_transition`. Static zone labels without a matching
verified row remain routeable, but their final waypoint kind is
`static_zone_label_hint` and the row records `static_zone_label_unverified`; the
planner must not mark a zone crossing until physical EQ log/current-state
readback proves it. If the current zone already matches the requested target
zone, the tool persists `abstain_already_in_target_zone` so stale pre-crossing
plans do not stay active after a transition.

Unknown zone, missing `/loc`, absent target, stale state, or conflicting map
calibration produce persisted abstain rows instead of guessed movement.
Manual FSV must read the physical map/current-state SoT before the trigger,
call this real MCP tool, and separately inspect `CF_KV` afterward.

}
```

`everquest_domain_normalize` defines and persists the #511 EverQuest
DynamicJEPA-compatible domain pack. Each call writes and reads back:

- `CF_KV/everquest/dynamicjepa_domain_pack/v1/everquest.live/everquest_dynamicjepa_v1`
- `CF_KV/everquest/dynamicjepa_state/v1/everquest.live/<transition_id>`
- `CF_KV/everquest/dynamicjepa_action/v1/everquest.live/<transition_id>`
- `CF_KV/everquest/dynamicjepa_outcome/v1/everquest.live/<transition_id>`
- `CF_KV/everquest/dynamicjepa_transition/v1/everquest.live/<transition_id>`

The domain pack mirrors ContextGraph DynamicJEPA conventions: explicit
state/action/outcome/entity fields, enumerated planner candidates, guard names,
surprise threshold, required verification row prefixes, and compatible
ContextGraph CF names. The transition row records invariant results for
zone-entry log updates, EQ foreground for movement/combat, con-safe combat,
no chat/social/economy actions, and impossible zone transitions.

Accepted rows are planner-eligible. Rejected rows persist failed invariant names
for inspection. `denied_unsafe` actions persist as denied rows and are never
planner-eligible. Missing required fields and invalid categorical variants fail
closed before storage mutation.

Manual FSV must read physical EQ UI/log/action/storage state before the trigger,
call this real MCP tool with a known action/log/observe cluster, and separately
inspect the five `CF_KV` rows afterward. The tool is not a training script and
does not replace runtime FSV for gameplay behavior.

### 3.13k `everquest_trajectory_record`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_trajectory_record",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["trajectory_id", "intent", "session_id", "transitions"],
    "properties": {
      "trajectory_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "intent": {"enum": ["navigation_probe", "target_consider_probe", "combat_attempt", "recovery", "level_up_run"]},

      "export_jsonl": {"type": "boolean", "default": true}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_trajectory_record` persists one ordered #512 trajectory row at
`CF_KV/everquest/trajectory/v1/everquest.live/<trajectory_id>` and, by
default, writes a JSONL provenance artifact under the local Synapse
EverQuest trajectory export directory. Each transition must link existing
physical source rows: a current-state row in `CF_KV`, at least one
`CF_ACTION_LOG` row, one `CF_OBSERVATIONS` row, one `CF_EVENTS` row, and one
bounded EQ log byte range. Optional refs can point to domain-transition,
outcome, guard, and map-state `CF_KV` rows.

The tool verifies linked source rows and physical log byte ranges before it
writes the trajectory. It rejects missing action/observation/event/log refs,
duplicate transition ids, out-of-order sequences/timestamps, missing source
rows, bad log offsets, and log hash mismatches. If the trajectory row already
exists, the tool returns the stored row with `duplicate_of_prior_row=true`
without rewriting storage or the export artifact.

Stored rows include transition order, source row key hex, value lengths,
compact summaries, trajectory hash, redaction flags, and an evidence boundary
stating that this is a runtime storage/export surface, not an FSV script. Raw
chat bodies and raw target names are not persisted.

Manual FSV must read `CF_KV`, source CF counts/samples, EQ log bytes, and the
export-file path before the trigger, call this real MCP tool with known linked
source refs, then separately inspect the trajectory row and JSONL artifact.

### 3.13l `everquest_episode_export`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_episode_export",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["export_id", "trajectory_row_keys"],
    "properties": {

      "output_path": {"type": "string"},
      "overwrite": {"type": "boolean", "default": false}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_episode_export` reads existing #512 trajectory rows and #511
DynamicJEPA state/action/outcome rows from `CF_KV`, then writes one compact
ContextGraph-compatible DynamicJEPA episode JSONL artifact under the local
Synapse EverQuest episode export root. Each line includes `source_of_truth`,
`state`, `action`, `outcome`, `transition`, `expected_persisted_delta`, and
`actual_readback` blocks.

The tool fails closed for empty exports, missing source rows, invalid schemas,
state/action/outcome linkage mismatches, unredacted log refs, raw chat/target
redaction flags, duplicate trajectory row keys, duplicate generated episode ids,
absolute output paths, non-JSONL output paths, and accidental overwrite. Raw
session ids are not written; the transition entity carries `session_id_sha256`
only.

Manual FSV must read the source `CF_KV` rows and target JSONL path before the
trigger, call this real MCP tool with known trajectory row keys, and separately
inspect the same rows plus final JSONL bytes afterward.

### 3.13l1 `everquest_contextgraph_ingest` / `everquest_contextgraph_search`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_contextgraph_ingest",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["ingest_id", "export_path", "expected_export_sha256", "contextgraph_storage_path"],
    "properties": {
      "ingest_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "export_path": {"type": "string"},
      "expected_export_sha256": {"type": "string"},
      "contextgraph_storage_path": {"type": "string"},
      "contextgraph_data_root": {"type": "string"},
      "contextgraph_command": {"type": "string", "default": "context-graph-mcp"},
      "no_warm": {"type": "boolean", "default": false},
      "timeout_ms": {"type": "integer", "default": 120000},
      "importance": {"type": "number", "default": 0.78}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_contextgraph_ingest` is the #529 bridge from #521 JSONL artifacts
into the real `ChrisRoyse/contextgraph` MCP tool surface. It reads the local
episode JSONL file, verifies the caller-supplied SHA-256, validates schema
version, record kind, ContextGraph compatibility metadata, and redaction flags,
then launches `context-graph-mcp --transport stdio` with the explicit
`CONTEXT_GRAPH_STORAGE_PATH`. It calls ContextGraph `store_memory`,
`get_provenance_chain`, and `get_audit_trail`, then persists
`CF_KV/everquest/contextgraph_ingest/v1/everquest.live/<export_sha>/<episode>`
bridge rows with fingerprint, source episode id, source export hash, storage
path, tags, and readback hashes. Stored ContextGraph content is a bounded
retrieval summary of the episode, not the full JSONL row, so the real sparse
embedder stays under its token ceiling. Duplicate same-hash episode rows return
the existing Synapse bridge row without storing a second ContextGraph memory.

The tool fails closed before ContextGraph mutation on missing/unreadable JSONL,
hash mismatch, malformed JSONL, wrong schema/record kind/profile, incompatible
ContextGraph block, unsafe redaction, or private chat/session/target payload
markers. ContextGraph unavailable, missing tools, JSON-RPC errors, missing
fingerprint ids, and tool-level `isError=true` also fail closed.

`everquest_contextgraph_search` queries the same ContextGraph storage with
EverQuest tags, requires returned content/provenance to cite
`source_episode_id=` and `source_export_sha256=` by default, and persists
`CF_KV/everquest/contextgraph_search/v1/everquest.live/<search_id>`.
ContextGraph is retrieval/long-term memory only; Synapse storage, EQ logs, and
visible UI remain the gameplay SoT for manual FSV.

### 3.13m `everquest_world_model_record`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_world_model_record",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",

      "write_mode": {"enum": ["create", "replace"], "default": "create"},
      "retention_class": {"enum": ["strategic", "episode", "scratch"], "default": "strategic"},
      "compact_redacted": {"type": "boolean", "default": true},
      "max_payload_bytes": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 32768, "default": 8192}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_world_model_record` persists one compact #513 world-model row in
`CF_KV` using only approved prefixes:

- `everquest/map/v1/everquest.live/<row_id>`
- `everquest/zone_graph/v1/everquest.live/<row_id>`
- `everquest/state/v1/everquest.live/<row_id>`
- `everquest/transition/v1/everquest.live/<row_id>`
- `everquest/trajectory/v1/everquest.live/<row_id>`
- `everquest/planner/v1/everquest.live/<row_id>`
- `everquest/surprise/v1/everquest.live/<row_id>`

For learned zone-transition volumes consumed by `everquest_route_plan`, use
`row_kind="transition"` and a compact payload with:
`verification_status="verified_zone_entry"`, `from_zone_short_name`,
`to_zone_short_name`, optional `label`, complete `pre_zone_location` and
`post_zone_location` objects with `map_x/map_y/map_z`, optional
`action_cluster`, and `confidence >= 0.70`. The source refs must point at the
physical EQ log zone-entry line, pre/post `/loc` evidence, and any storage or
action rows used to reconstruct the crossing. Rows missing post-zone `/loc`,
with unexpected destination zones, or with low confidence are storage evidence
only and must not become planner-eligible transition volumes.

Rows include schema version, profile id, world-model kind, row id/key,
created/updated timestamps, revision, previous payload hash on replace,
payload SHA-256/length, compact source provenance refs, redaction flags,
retention class, hard caps, and an evidence-boundary block stating that runtime
manual FSV is still required. Strategic rows have no TTL and are pressure
preserved; episode rows use a 30-day TTL; scratch rows use a 24-hour TTL and
are not pressure preserved.

The writer rejects non-`everquest.live` profiles, invalid row ids, empty or
non-object payloads, payloads over the declared/hard cap, missing source refs,
too many source refs, malformed SHA-256 refs, duplicate create writes,
replace-without-existing-row, and payload keys/strings that look like raw
chat/message bodies. Raw chat bodies and raw target names are not persisted.

Manual FSV must read `CF_KV` before the trigger, call this real MCP tool with
known synthetic payloads and source refs, then separately inspect the selected
row and storage/WAL state afterward. This tool is a storage/readback surface,
not an FSV script or gameplay-success proof.

### 3.13n `everquest_world_model_inspect`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_world_model_inspect",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,

      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},

      "row_key": {"type": "string"},
      "sample_limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 64, "default": 8},
      "include_payload": {"type": "boolean", "default": false}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_world_model_inspect` reads `CF_KV` counts and redacted samples for
the approved #513 world-model prefixes. It can also read a selected key when
the key starts with one of the approved `everquest/.../v1/everquest.live/`
prefixes. Counts are bounded by the tool scan cap, and samples omit payloads
unless `include_payload=true` is explicitly requested.

This is the normal compact readback surface for planners, ContextGraph export,
surprise detection, and manual FSV evidence. It does not parse raw EQ logs or
drive game input.

### 3.13o `everquest_surprise_detect`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_surprise_detect",

    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_surprise_detect` compares a compact predicted action/outcome
against observed state or log evidence, then writes a compatible
`everquest_world_model_record` row at
`CF_KV/everquest/surprise/v1/everquest.live/<surprise_id>`. It records the
decision, divergence score, compared fields, mismatch reasons, remediation
steps, and whether gameplay should stop for state repair. It never executes
input.

Missing prediction, stale observation, false/low-confidence OCR-style zone
evidence, and low-confidence current state all fail closed with a persisted
stop/repair row instead of treating the planner state as safe. Manual FSV must
read physical EQ log/current-state/storage before the trigger, call the real
MCP tool, then separately inspect `CF_KV`, `everquest_world_model_inspect`, and
the physical DB bytes afterward.

### 3.13p `everquest_world_summary`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_world_summary",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["summary_id"],
    "properties": {
      "summary_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "state_row_key": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest/current_state/v1/everquest.live"},
      "state_override": {"type": "object"},
      "install_root_override": {"type": "string"},
      "max_exits": {"type": "integer", "default": 5},

      "stale_after_seconds": {"type": "integer", "default": 300},
      "source_refs": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_world_summary` writes one compact context-injection row at
`CF_KV/everquest/world_summary/v1/everquest.live/<summary_id>`. It reads the
persisted current-state row by default, builds local-map context from the EQ
install maps, and stores bounded zone/position confidence, nearest exits and
landmarks, recent transitions, safe next probes, level state, focus state,
hazards, active blockers, source refs, and compaction recovery links to #501,
#500, and #505.

The summary executes no input and must not carry raw chat bodies. Missing or
unknown zone, missing map graph, stale state, non-EQ foreground, and
low-confidence zone/location state persist explicit blockers rather than
pretending the agent can navigate safely. Manual FSV must read the physical EQ
map/log/current-state/storage source before the trigger, call the real MCP
tool with known expected outputs, then separately inspect `storage_inspect` and
the physical DB bytes afterward. The summary is context evidence only; movement
and level-progress claims still require separate gameplay FSV.

### 3.13q `everquest_predictive_model_fit`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_predictive_model_fit",

      "limitations": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "default": []}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_predictive_model_fit` reads verified #512 trajectory rows plus their
linked #511 DynamicJEPA state/action/outcome/transition rows, builds a
transparent action-conditioned Markov baseline, writes
`CF_KV/everquest/predictive_model/v1/everquest.live/<model_id>`, computes a
stable model hash, and reads the exact row back. Empty or sparse data writes an
explicit `no_verified_trajectories` or `insufficient_transition_support` model
instead of pretending competence.

The model stores state-action entries, action fallbacks, a global fallback,
source trajectory/transition keys, conflict counts, confidence thresholds, and
an evidence boundary that says this is planning-quality evidence only. It is not
a training script, FSV substitute, or gameplay-progress proof.

```

`everquest_predictive_model_predict` reads the model row and current
DynamicJEPA state row, ranks candidate actions by exact state-action entry,
action fallback, then global fallback, writes
`CF_KV/everquest/prediction/v1/everquest.live/<prediction_id>`, and reads the
exact prediction row back. It abstains for stale model hashes, no data, no
candidate actions, no matching entry, insufficient support, or confidence below
threshold.

Manual FSV for both #522 tools must read the trajectory/domain/state/model/
prediction `CF_KV` rows before the trigger, call the real MCP tool with known
inputs, then separately inspect the persisted rows afterward. The happy path
must compare one prediction to a later observed outcome through the real
action-prior sample surface; edges must include no data, conflicting data,
stale model hash, and uncertainty above threshold.

}
```

`everquest_action_prior_record` stores one redacted prediction/outcome sample
at `CF_KV/everquest/action_prior_eval/v1/everquest.live/<sample_id>`. It
computes correctness classes (`correct_top1`, `correct_top3`,
`correct_context`, `wrong`, `abstained`, or `unknown_actual`), confidence
bucket, overconfident-wrong flag, abstention flag, and source refs before
writing the row. It then reads the exact key back before returning.

The tool is a real runtime storage surface for planning-quality evaluation, not
an FSV substitute. Manual FSV must still read storage state before the trigger,
call the tool with known synthetic prediction/outcome inputs, and separately
read `storage_inspect` or another physical storage readback after the write.

### 3.13t `everquest_action_prior_scorecard`

```json
{
  "name": "everquest_action_prior_scorecard",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["window_id"],
    "properties": {
      "window_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string", "default": "everquest.live"},
      "sample_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "default": []},
      "min_samples": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "default": 3},
      "min_confidence_for_action": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.0, "maximum": 1.0, "default": 0.6},
      "competence_floor": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.0, "maximum": 1.0, "default": 0.6},
      "stretch_target": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.0, "maximum": 1.0, "default": 0.8},
      "limitations": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
    }
  }
}
```

`everquest_action_prior_scorecard` reads the named eval rows, computes
window bounds from sample record times, aggregates source episode ids, computes
top-1, top-3, zone, coordinate-bucket, hazard-avoidance, useful-accuracy,
abstention, surprise, low-confidence-action, overconfident-wrong, and
calibration-bucket metrics, then writes
`CF_KV/everquest/action_prior_scorecard/v1/everquest.live/<window_id>` and
reads that exact row back.

The default competence floor is `0.60` and the default stretch target is
`0.80`. The row explicitly records `minimum_is_floor_not_ceiling=true`; hitting
the floor means the AI is useful enough for supervised play, not that
optimization stops. Empty or tiny sample windows produce `no_verified_trajectories`
or `insufficient_samples` rather than a false competence claim. Low confidence
must abstain instead of forcing game input; any non-abstaining action below
`min_confidence_for_action` records `low_confidence_action_forced` and does not
meet the competence floor.

### 3.14 `act_aim`

```json
{
  "name": "act_aim",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["target"],
    "properties": {
      "target": {
        "oneOf": [
          {"type": "object", "required": ["x","y"], "properties": {"x":{"type":"integer"}, "y":{"type":"integer"}}},
          {"type": "object", "required": ["element_id"], "properties": {"element_id":{"type":"string"}}},
          {"type": "object", "required": ["track_id"], "properties": {"track_id":{"type":"integer"}}}

      "deadline_ms": {"type": "integer", "default": 80},
      "backend": {"enum": ["software","hardware","auto"], "default": "auto"}
    }
  }
}
```

`style: "track"` registers an aim_track reflex and returns its `reflex_id` instead of completing immediately. Cancel via `reflex_cancel`.
Screen-point targets (`x`, `y`) are physical pixels (DPI-aware), matching UI Automation bounding boxes and per-monitor-DPI-aware `GetCursorPos`; see [03_action.md §13](03_action.md#13-click-on-element-semantics).

### 3.15 `act_drag`

      "backend": {"enum": ["software","hardware","auto"], "default": "auto"}
    }
  }
}
```

Coordinate `from` / `to` endpoints are physical pixels (DPI-aware), matching UI Automation bounding boxes and per-monitor-DPI-aware `GetCursorPos`; see [03_action.md §13](03_action.md#13-click-on-element-semantics).

### 3.16 `act_scroll`

```json
{
  "name": "act_scroll",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {

      "smooth": {"type": "boolean", "default": false, "description": "Split into multiple small wheel events for animation"}
    }
  }
}
```

The optional `at` cursor target is in physical pixels (DPI-aware), matching UI Automation bounding boxes and per-monitor-DPI-aware `GetCursorPos`; see [03_action.md §13](03_action.md#13-click-on-element-semantics).

### 3.17 `act_pad`

Drives a virtual or hardware gamepad.

```json
{
  "name": "act_pad",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["pad_id"],

      "hold_ms": {"type": "integer", "description": "If set, applies report for this duration then returns to neutral"}
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.18 `act_combo` (M4)

Schedules a one-shot timed combo through the reflex scheduler. The tool is an
M4 addition and must appear in `tools/list` only when its real runtime path is
implemented.

```json
{
  "name": "act_combo",
  "description": "Execute a timed one-shot sequence of already-supported action tools through the reflex combo scheduler.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["steps"],
    "properties": {
      "steps": {
        "type": "array",
        "minItems": 1,
        "maxItems": 256,
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "additionalProperties": false,
          "required": ["at_ms", "action", "params"],
          "properties": {
            "at_ms": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0},
            "action": {
              "enum": ["act_click", "act_type", "act_press", "act_aim", "act_drag", "act_scroll", "act_pad", "act_clipboard", "release_all"]
            },
            "params": {"type": "object", "description": "Validated against the selected action tool's schema before scheduling"},
            "backend": {"enum": ["software", "hardware", "vigem", "auto"]}
          }
        }
      },
      "backend": {"enum": ["software", "hardware", "vigem", "auto"], "default": "auto"},
      "idempotency_key": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "combo_id": "uuid",
  "scheduled_steps": 3,
  "backend": "auto",
  "started_at_ms": 0
}
```

Required permissions:

- `WRITE_REFLEX`
- `INPUT_KEYBOARD`, `INPUT_MOUSE`, `INPUT_PAD`, and/or `INPUT_HARDWARE_HID`
  according to the nested step actions and chosen backend.

Rules:

- `at_ms` values must be monotonic.
- `act_run_shell`, `act_launch`, subscription tools, storage diagnostics, and
  profile writes are not valid combo steps.
- Step `params` must pass the selected action tool's own schema before the
  combo is scheduled.
- Unknown-scope profile gates still apply; denied action emission returns
  `SAFETY_PROFILE_ACTION_DENIED`.

Errors: `TOOL_PARAMS_INVALID`, `SAFETY_PERMISSION_DENIED`,
`SAFETY_PROFILE_ACTION_DENIED`, `ACTION_BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE`,
`ACTION_HID_PORT_DISCONNECTED`, `ACTION_QUEUE_FULL`,
`REFLEX_ACTION_PERMISSION_DENIED`.

### 3.19 `act_clipboard`

```json
{
  "name": "act_clipboard",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "verb": {"enum": ["read","write","clear"]},
      "text": {"type": "string", "description": "Required for write"},
      "format": {"enum": ["text","unicode"], "default": "unicode"}
    },
    "required": ["verb"]
  }
}
```

### 3.20 `act_run_shell` (M4)

Runs an allowlisted local shell command. Disabled unless `--allow-shell
<regex>` was passed at startup. Broad allowlists such as `.*` are rejected at
startup per `11_security_and_safety.md`; accepted shell patterns must be
full-command-line anchored and must not match empty input.

```json
{
  "name": "act_run_shell",
  "description": "Run a local shell command only when the startup allowlist permits the resolved command line.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["command"],
    "properties": {
      "command": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1},
      "args": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "default": []},
      "working_dir": {"type": "string"},
      "env": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}, "default": {}},
      "timeout_ms": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 600000, "default": 30000},
      "idempotency_key": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "exit_code": 0,
  "stdout": "...",
  "stderr": "...",
  "duration_ms": 152,
  "timed_out": false,
  "stdout_truncated": false,
  "stderr_truncated": false
}
```

Required policy gate: startup `--allow-shell <regex>` must match the resolved
command line. M4 may add a dedicated permission enum later; until then the
allowlist is the required permission surface.

Rules:

- `command + args` are resolved into a command line before allowlist matching.
- Shell allowlist patterns are validated at startup and rejected if empty,
  unanchored, matching empty, or using catch-all any-character repetition such
  as `.*` / `.+`.
- `env` defaults to `{}` and extends a restricted child environment containing
  only `PATH`, `USERPROFILE`, `TEMP`, `SystemRoot`, plus any variables the child
  interpreter synthesizes after launch.
- `working_dir` defaults to the daemon's current directory if omitted.
- Stdout/stderr are capped at 1 MiB each and report truncation flags.
- Timeout kills the subprocess and returns `timed_out: true` with captured
  output up to the cap.

Errors: `TOOL_PARAMS_INVALID`, `SAFETY_SHELL_DENIED_BY_POLICY`,
`SAFETY_PERMISSION_DENIED`, `ACTION_TARGET_INVALID`.

### 3.21 `act_launch` (M4)

Launches an allowlisted local process and optionally waits for a window title.
Disabled unless `--allow-launch <regex>` was passed at startup. Broad allowlists
such as `.*` are rejected at startup per `11_security_and_safety.md`.

```json
{
  "name": "act_launch",
  "description": "Launch an allowlisted local executable and optionally wait for a matching window title.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["target"],
    "properties": {
      "target": {"type": "string", "description": "Executable name (e.g., 'notepad.exe') or Steam appid (e.g., 'steam://run/440')"},
      "args": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "default": []},
      "working_dir": {"type": "string"},
      "env": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}, "default": {}},
      "wait_for_window_title_regex": {"type": "string"},
      "timeout_ms": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 600000, "default": 10000},
      "idempotency_key": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "pid": 12345,
  "hwnd": 67890,
  "matched_title": "Untitled - Notepad",
  "launched_at": "...",
  "reason": null
}
```

If a window wait was requested but no matching title appears before the
timeout, the process launch can still succeed with:

```json
{
  "pid": 12345,
  "hwnd": null,
  "matched_title": null,
  "launched_at": "...",
  "reason": "no_match_within_timeout"
}
```

Required policy gate: startup `--allow-launch <regex>` must match the resolved
command line made from `target` plus `args` using the same quoting rules as
`act_run_shell`. M4 may add a dedicated permission enum later; until then the
allowlist is the required permission surface.

Rules:

- `args` defaults to `[]`.
- `env` defaults to `{}` and extends a restricted child environment containing
  only `PATH`, `USERPROFILE`, `TEMP`, `SystemRoot`.
- `working_dir` defaults to the daemon's current directory if omitted.
- On Windows, path-like `target` values are resolved through Win32
  `GetLongPathNameW` before allowlist matching. Bare executable names such as
  `javaw.exe` and URI targets such as `steam://run/...` match as provided.
- `wait_for_window_title_regex` is optional. When present, the tool reads real
  window state until `timeout_ms` expires.
- `reason` is `null` on full process/window success, `no_match_within_timeout`
  when the launch succeeds but the optional title wait times out, and
  `window_readback_unavailable` when the host window-readback layer is
  unavailable.

Errors: `TOOL_PARAMS_INVALID`, `SAFETY_LAUNCH_DENIED_BY_POLICY`,
`SAFETY_PERMISSION_DENIED`, `ACTION_TARGET_INVALID`.

### 3.22 `reflex_register`

```json
{
  "name": "reflex_register",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["kind","params"],
    "properties": {
      "kind": {"enum": ["aim_track","hold_move","hold_button","combo","on_event"]},
      "params": {"type": "object"},
      "priority": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100},
      "lifetime": {"$ref": "#/$defs/ReflexLifetime"},
      "exclusive": {"type": "boolean", "default": false}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns `{ "reflex_id": "..." }`.

### 3.23 `reflex_cancel`

```json
{
  "name": "reflex_cancel",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["reflex_id"],
    "properties": {"reflex_id": {"type": "string"}}
  }
}
```

### 3.24 `reflex_list`

Returns all currently-active reflexes for this session with state.

### 3.25 `reflex_history`

Returns past reflex events (fires, cancellations, lifetime expiries, conflicts) within a time window.

```json
{
  "name": "reflex_history",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "since_ms_ago": {"type": "integer", "default": 60000},
      "reflex_id": {"type": "string"},
      "kinds": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.26 `release_all`

```json
{"name": "release_all", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false}}
```

Returns count of released inputs by class.

### 3.27 `profile_list`

```json
{"name": "profile_list", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "properties": {"include_inactive": {"type": "boolean", "default": true}}}}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "profiles": [
    {"id": "minecraft.java", "label": "Minecraft Java Edition", "detection_model_id": "rtdetr_v2_s_coco_onnx", "matches": [{"exe": "javaw.exe", "title_regex": "Minecraft.*"}]},
    {"id": "vscode", "label": "Visual Studio Code", "detection_model_id": null, "matches": [{"exe": "Code.exe", "title_regex": null}]}
  ],
  "active_profile_id": "vscode"
}
```

### 3.28 `profile_activate`

```json
{
  "name": "profile_activate",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["profile_id"],
    "properties": {"profile_id": {"type": "string"}}
  }
}
```

### 3.28a `profile_authoring_generate`

Generates a local candidate profile patch from real replay/audit evidence and
writes it as a separate candidate row. The physical SoT is `CF_PROFILES` key
`profile_authoring/v1/candidate/<candidate_id>`. The candidate is never an
active profile; approval only changes candidate state.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_authoring_generate",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["profile_id"],
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "replay_path": {"type": "string"},
      "max_audit_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 10000, "default": 500},
      "max_replay_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 10000, "default": 500},
      "candidate_id": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Evidence can add matches, HUD fields, keymaps, backend defaults, detection
classes, reflex combo proposals, use-scope hints, and safety metadata. The
stored row contains source CF names, replay path, source audit keys/ids,
evidence hash, evidence summary, expected improvement, generated timestamp,
candidate state, patch, and a safety review. It fails closed with
`PROFILE_AUTHORING_INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`,
`PROFILE_AUTHORING_CONFLICTING_EVIDENCE`, or
`PROFILE_AUTHORING_UNSAFE_ESCALATION` before writing a candidate row.

### 3.28b `profile_authoring_list`

Lists local profile-authoring candidates from `CF_PROFILES` without activating
or mutating them.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_authoring_list",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "state": {"enum": ["candidate", "accepted", "rejected"]},
      "limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns the `CF_PROFILES` prefix, filters, total matched count, and bounded
candidate summaries with row keys, state, evidence hash, expected improvement,
and stored value size.

### 3.28c `profile_authoring_inspect`

Reads one local candidate row by candidate id.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_authoring_inspect",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["candidate_id"],
    "properties": {"candidate_id": {"type": "string"}}
  }
}
```

Returns `found=false` for a missing row. Found rows return the full stored
candidate plus the summary used by `profile_authoring_list`.

### 3.28d `profile_authoring_accept`

Marks a candidate row accepted and reads it back. It does not activate,
install, or overwrite any active/bundled profile.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_authoring_accept",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["candidate_id"],
    "properties": {
      "candidate_id": {"type": "string"},
      "operator_note": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Accepting from `candidate` writes `state="accepted"`, `accepted_at_ns`, and the
optional note. Re-accepting an already accepted row is idempotent. Any other
state fails closed with `PROFILE_AUTHORING_INVALID_STATE`.

### 3.28e `profile_authoring_reject`

Marks a candidate row rejected and reads it back.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_authoring_reject",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["candidate_id"],
    "properties": {
      "candidate_id": {"type": "string"},
      "reason": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Rejecting from `candidate` writes `state="rejected"`, `rejected_at_ns`, and the
optional reason. Re-rejecting an already rejected row is idempotent. Any other
state fails closed with `PROFILE_AUTHORING_INVALID_STATE`.

### 3.28f `profile_authoring_export`

Writes one candidate as a local JSON export file after reading the candidate
from `CF_PROFILES`.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_authoring_export",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["candidate_id", "output_path"],
    "properties": {
      "candidate_id": {"type": "string"},
      "output_path": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

The bundle contains the schema version, export timestamp, source CF/key, and
the full candidate row. The tool parses the written file before returning so a
manual FSV run can separately inspect both the candidate row and the export
file bytes.

### 3.28g `profile_quality_refresh`

Refreshes the local profile-registry quality snapshot for one profile from real
stored action audit rows, observation/event rows, and #536 reality rows. This
is a local-only read/aggregate/write/readback surface: it scans
`CF_ACTION_LOG`, `CF_OBSERVATIONS`, `CF_EVENTS`, and bounded
`CF_KV/reality/*` rows, writes the redacted snapshot to
`CF_PROFILES` at `profile_quality/v1/<profile_id>`, then reads that exact row
back before returning.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_quality_refresh",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["profile_id"],
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "max_audit_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 50000, "default": 5000},
      "stale_after_ns": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "default": 86400000000000},
      "manual_fsv_evidence_ref": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns the `CF_PROFILES` key, whether a new snapshot was written, stored value
length/prefix, and an explainable snapshot containing source row counts,
ignored corrupt/stale rows, quality counts/rates, Wilson lower-bound score,
compatibility counters, profile-schema-version recency/mixed-version counters,
runtime observation/event evidence, compact event-kind and log-kind counters,
and `reality_evidence`: baseline/head/delta/audit row counts, audited vs
unaudited delta counts, drift/rebase/source-unavailable audit rates,
delta-kind/path counts, source-surface counts, latest bounded epoch/audit
metadata, and compatibility flags for `delta_first_supported` vs
`full_snapshot_required`. Delta rows do not raise quality by themselves:
`audited_delta_rows` is counted only when a persisted `reality_audit` covers the
delta sequence. No-op `observe_delta` calls persist no delta rows, so the
snapshot records `no_op_ratio_source` instead of inventing a no-op ratio.

The response also includes an optional manual FSV evidence reference, redaction
policy, and contribution policy. Export is always `false`; sharing requires a
future explicit operator-approved path. The snapshot keeps bounded identifiers
and counts only; it must not persist raw chat bodies, window titles, process
paths, private session tickets, full raw log lines, screenshots, or unbounded
filesystem paths.

### 3.28h `profile_registry_search`

Searches local registry rows under `profile_registry/v1/` in `CF_PROFILES`.
This is the operator-facing list/search readback for source/package/profile/
installed/compatibility/curated-target/quality-link rows.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_registry_search",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "query": {"type": "string"},
      "row_kind": {"type": "string"},
      "include_disabled": {"type": "boolean", "default": false},
      "limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns `cf_name`, `prefix`, filters, `total_matched`, and row summaries with
UTF-8 keys, hex keys, row kind/id, state, profile/package ids, update time, and
bounded value prefix.

### 3.28i `profile_registry_inspect`

Reads one registry row by exact key or derived id. `profile_registry/v1/head/*`
keys read `CF_KV`; all other `profile_registry/v1/*` keys read `CF_PROFILES`.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_registry_inspect",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "row_key": {"type": "string"},
      "source_id": {"type": "string"},
      "package_id": {"type": "string"},
      "package_version": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "profile_version": {"type": "string"},
      "installed_profile_id": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns `cf_name`, `row_key`, `found`, and when found the full decoded JSON row
plus the same row summary used by search.

### 3.28j `profile_registry_report`

Returns an operator-facing read-only report over the local
profile-registry/audit moat. It reads registry rows, installed package state,
curated starter targets, quarantine rows, rollback rows, quality snapshots,
audit-export consent, recent action audit evidence, and direct physical SoT
pointers for manual verification.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_registry_report",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100},
      "max_audit_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100}
    }
  }
}
```

The response includes the RocksDB storage path, row counts, exact CF/key
pointers, installed profile/package summaries, curated target rows,
quarantined packages, rollback rows, quality scores including stale evidence
counts, consent/export readiness, recent audit bucket counts, and an explicit
control list for install/rollback/export/import/quality/consent/export-bundle.
It performs no writes and never enables hidden sharing.

### 3.28k `profile_registry_install`

Validates a local profile package manifest, verifies signed package trust when
policy requires it, parses the referenced profile TOML, checks
manifest/profile id agreement, writes local registry rows to `CF_PROFILES`,
writes the source head pointer to `CF_KV`, and reads the written rows back
before returning. If signed trust verification fails, the tool writes a
`profile_package_quarantine` row and returns `PROFILE_TRUST_VERIFICATION_FAILED`
without writing package/profile/installed/head rows.
If the manifest carries complete `curated.*` metadata, install also writes a
`curated_profile_target` row under
`profile_registry/v1/curated_target/<seed_set_id>/<target_id>`. Partial
curated metadata, or a curated target id without matching compatibility target,
fails closed before any companion rows are written.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_registry_install",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["manifest_path"],
    "properties": {
      "manifest_path": {"type": "string"},
      "expected_manifest_digest": {"type": "string"},
      "source_id": {"type": "string", "default": "registry.local"},
      "trust_policy": {"enum": ["local_first", "signed_required"], "default": "local_first"}
    }
  }
}
```

Duplicate package id/version with the same manifest digest is idempotent.
Duplicate id/version with a different digest fails closed with no companion-row
rewrite. The response returns `manifest_digest`, profile TOML path, `wrote_rows`,
`idempotent`, trust/signature status, signer/trust-root readback, row keys, and
row summaries. Installable package manifests must be local-only
(`local_only=true`, `remote_server_allowed=false`) and metadata text is rejected
if it contains prompt/tool-injection markers.

### 3.28l `profile_registry_disable`

Marks an installed registry row disabled or removed in `CF_PROFILES` and reads
the updated row back.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_registry_disable",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["profile_id"],
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "state": {"enum": ["disabled", "removed"], "default": "disabled"},
      "reason": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns previous/current state, the row key, and the decoded stored row.

### 3.28m `profile_registry_export`

Exports local registry rows from `CF_PROFILES` and `CF_KV` into a JSON bundle on
disk. With `bundle_kind = "contribution"`, the same tool also includes
deterministic component hashes, redacted action-audit evidence summaries, and
the profile quality summary for a specific `profile_id`.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_registry_export",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["output_path"],
    "properties": {
      "output_path": {"type": "string"},
      "bundle_kind": {"type": "string", "default": "registry"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "query": {"type": "string"},
      "row_kind": {"type": "string"},
      "include_disabled": {"type": "boolean", "default": false},
      "include_audit_evidence": {"type": "boolean", "default": true},
      "include_quality_summary": {"type": "boolean", "default": true},
      "max_audit_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100},
      "limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100}
    }
  }
}
```

Returns output path, bundle kind, bytes written, exported row count, component
hashes, redacted evidence counts, and row summaries.

### 3.28n `profile_registry_import`

Imports a local JSON registry bundle after validating schema version, supported
CF names, `profile_registry/v1/` key namespace, object-valued rows, and any
deterministic bundle hashes present. Byte-identical rows are skipped on
duplicate import; contribution rows with the same deterministic content are
also skipped even when the exact bundle-file hash differs. Same-key/different
value conflicts fail closed before writes. Imported contribution evidence is
staged under `profile_registry/v1/contribution/`. Contribution import runs a
local abuse review before active-row writes. Hostile bundles write only a
quarantined contribution row with explicit `risk_flags`; staged bundles carry
`rank_eligible=false`, `quality_weight=0`, and
`external_quality_claims_trusted=false` until local success evidence exists on
this host.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_registry_import",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["bundle_path"],
    "properties": {"bundle_path": {"type": "string"}}
  }
}
```

Returns bundle kind, read row count, per-CF write counts, duplicate count,
optional contribution row key, deterministic bundle hash, and row summaries.

### 3.28o `profile_registry_rollback`

Rewrites `profile_registry/v1/installed/<profile_id>` to a prior active package
whose package row is `trusted` or `local_validated`, and writes a
`profile_registry_rollback` row under `profile_registry/v1/rollback/`.

```json
{
  "name": "profile_registry_rollback",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["profile_id"],
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "target_package_id": {"type": "string"},
      "target_package_version": {"type": "string"},
      "reason": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

If no target is supplied, the tool selects the newest prior known-good package
for the profile. It fails closed with `PROFILE_ROLLBACK_UNAVAILABLE` if no
known-good target exists, the target is current, revoked, quarantined, or not
trusted/local-validated. The response includes the previous and rolled-back
package id/version plus readback of both the installed and rollback rows. The
installed row readback must carry the rolled-back package's trust/signature
metadata, not stale metadata from the package being replaced.

### 3.28p `audit_intelligence_query`

Summarizes profile-linked outcomes across the audit SoTs now populated by
profile activation, action, and reflex paths.

```json
{
  "name": "audit_intelligence_query",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["profile_id"],
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "max_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100}
    }
  }
}
```

Reads newest rows from `CF_ACTION_LOG`, `CF_EVENTS`, `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT`, and
`CF_SESSIONS`, reads `CF_PROFILES` quality snapshot
`profile_quality/v1/<profile_id>` when present, and returns bucket counts by
status/tool/kind/error code plus learning candidates.

### 3.28q `audit_export_consent_set`

Writes the local consent state required before any audit export bundle can be
created. The physical SoT is `CF_KV` key
`audit_export/v1/consent/<profile_id>`. The tool writes the row and immediately
reads that same key back before returning.

```json
{
  "name": "audit_export_consent_set",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["profile_id", "enabled"],
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "enabled": {"type": "boolean"},
      "redaction_policy": {"type": "string", "default": "strict"},
      "operator_note": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

The stored row includes `row_kind="audit_export_consent"`, enabled/disabled
state, selected policy, allowed policies, `external_sharing_allowed=false`, and
operator note. Unsupported policies fail closed with
`AUDIT_EXPORT_REDACTION_REQUIRED`.

### 3.28r `audit_export_bundle`

Creates a local, redacted audit export bundle only after consent and redaction
policy verification. The trigger reads `CF_KV` consent state and newest
`CF_ACTION_LOG` rows for the requested profile, redacts sensitive fields, and
writes an operator-visible directory containing:

- `manifest.json`
- `rows.json`
- `redaction_report.json`

```json
{
  "name": "audit_export_bundle",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["profile_id", "output_path"],
    "properties": {
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"},
      "output_path": {"type": "string"},
      "redaction_policy": {"type": "string"},
      "max_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000, "default": 100},
      "max_row_bytes": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 524288, "default": 65536}
    }
  }
}
```

`redaction_policy` is runtime-required even though it is optional in the schema
so callers must consciously select the policy consented by the operator. The
only current policy is `strict`. Strict redaction removes window titles, paths,
command lines, exact timing fields, OCR/text/clipboard/transcript fields,
screenshots/images/pixels, user identifiers, and high-cardinality IDs while
retaining bounded signals such as profile id/version/schema, process name,
tool, status, error code, and backend.

The manifest records schema version, bundle kind, source CF, consent key and
hash, redaction policy, row/file hashes, row counts, and
`external_sharing_allowed=false`. The redaction report records counts by
redaction class and the fail-closed rules. Missing/disabled consent returns
`AUDIT_EXPORT_CONSENT_REQUIRED`; missing/unsupported policy returns
`AUDIT_EXPORT_REDACTION_REQUIRED`; a matching row larger than `max_row_bytes`
returns `AUDIT_EXPORT_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` before bundle files are written.

### 3.29 `health`

```json
{"name": "health", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false}}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "subsystems": {
    "storage": {"status": "ok", "db_path": "...", "schema_version": 7, "cf_sizes": {"CF_REFLEX_AUDIT": 4096}},
    "reflex": {"status": "ok", "active_count": 2, "last_tick_jitter_us": 180, "recursion_clamps_total": 0},
    "profiles": {"status": "ok", "active_profile_id": "notepad", "profile_count": 4, "last_reload_at": "1779723537765"},
    "hid_host": {"status": "disabled", "detail": "hardware HID disabled; start with --hardware-hid <port|auto> or SYNAPSE_HARDWARE_HID"},
    "audio": {"status": "disabled", "ring_buffer_seconds": 5, "stt_model_loaded": false},
    "http": {"status": "ok", "bind_addr": "127.0.0.1:7700", "active_sessions": 1, "sse_subscribers": 0}
  },
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "uptime_s": 1245
}
```

`hid_host` reports the configured hardware HID target separately from the
generic action subsystem. It is `disabled` when no hardware backend was
requested, `ok` when a configured hardware target initialized with a live action
emitter, and `error` if the configured target exists but the action emitter is
not available.

M3 subsystem status strings are `initializing`, `ok`, `degraded_latency`,
`disk_pressure_l1`..`disk_pressure_l4`, `disabled`, or `error`.

### 3.30 `replay_record`

```json
{
  "name": "replay_record",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["verb"],
    "properties": {
      "verb": {"enum": ["start","stop","status"]},
      "session_id": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.31 `storage_inspect`

Operator-facing storage readback for manual FSV. This reads exact row counts,
logical byte sizes, bounded newest-row samples, schema version, and in-process
disk-pressure transition codes from the live RocksDB-backed runtime.

```json
{"name": "storage_inspect", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false}}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "pressure_level": {"name": "Normal", "value": 0},
  "pressure_transition_codes": [],
  "audit_retention_policies": [
    {
      "audit_class": "actions",
      "cf_name": "CF_ACTION_LOG",
      "key_prefix": null,
      "ttl": "24h",
      "ttl_ns": 86400000000000,
      "dedupe_key_fields": ["profile_id", "tool", "status", "error_code"],
      "pressure_preserve": false,
      "strategic": false
    }
  ],
  "cf_row_counts": {"CF_EVENTS": 4},
  "cf_sizes": {"CF_EVENTS": 248},
  "cf_row_samples": {
    "CF_ACTION_LOG": [
      {
        "key_hex": "1870e8a94f2b000000000001",
        "value_len_bytes": 512,
        "value_utf8_prefix": "{\"tool\":\"act_press\",\"status\":\"ok\"",
        "value_truncated": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`cf_row_samples` is a bounded newest-row readback for manual FSV. It is not an
automation substitute; agents still define the Source of Truth, trigger the
real runtime surface, then read and record the physical row data they expect to
change.

### 3.32 `storage_put_probe_rows`

Writes bounded synthetic rows to a small allow-list of diagnostic column
families (`CF_EVENTS`, `CF_OBSERVATIONS`, `CF_SESSIONS`, `CF_ACTION_LOG`,
`CF_KV`) and flushes them. This exists so manual storage FSV can use known
synthetic inputs and then read the physical storage state through
`storage_inspect`; `CF_ACTION_LOG` probe rows are deliberately useful for
corrupt-audit-row edge checks because profile quality scoring ignores malformed
rows for score changes.

```json
{
  "name": "storage_put_probe_rows",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["cf_name", "key_prefix", "rows", "value_bytes"],
    "properties": {
      "cf_name": {"type": "string"},
      "key_prefix": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 128},
      "rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 10000},
      "value_bytes": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 65536},
      "value_json": {"type": "object"},
      "ts_ns_start": {"type": "integer"},
      "ts_ns_step": {"type": "integer"}
    }
  }
}
```

When `value_json` is supplied, the tool writes that JSON object as the row
value, adding deterministic `probe_id`, `seq`, and optional `ts_ns`/`audit_id`
from `ts_ns_start` + `ts_ns_step` only when those fields are absent. This keeps
manual storage/audit FSV on the real MCP runtime surface while still using
known synthetic input rows.

### 3.33 `storage_gc_once`

Runs one row-cap GC pass for a diagnostic column family. When `cf_name` is
`AUDIT_RETENTION`, the same tool runs the M5 audit-data retention path without
adding another MCP tool: it classifies profile-linked audit rows, preserves
unknown-schema rows, backfills missing top-level `profile_id` /
`profile_schema_version` from existing M3/M4 audit context, dedupes repeated
outcomes, applies row caps, and writes a durable report row to
`CF_KV/audit_retention/v1/report/<run_id>`. Manual FSV reads `storage_inspect`
before, calls this trigger, then reads `storage_inspect` and the report row
afterward.
The policy list also covers the M4 reality namespace: `reality_baselines`,
`reality_heads`, and `reality_audits` are strategic preserve classes in
`CF_KV`, and `reality_delta_journal` caps the high-frequency
`CF_KV/reality/delta/v1/` rows without deleting the current baseline/head/audit
evidence.
Retention backfills and report rows use the storage-maintenance write path, so
Level3/Level4 disk pressure cannot silently drop the migration/report evidence;
ordinary probe and ingestion writes remain pressure-gated.

```json
{
  "name": "storage_gc_once",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["cf_name", "soft_cap_rows", "hard_cap_rows"],
    "properties": {
      "cf_name": {"type": "string"},
      "soft_cap_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000000},
      "hard_cap_rows": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 1000000},
      "run_id": {"type": "string"},
      "now_ns": {"type": "integer"},
      "max_age_ns": {"type": "integer"},
      "dedupe_window_ns": {"type": "integer"},
      "profile_id": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

`run_id`, `now_ns`, `max_age_ns`, `dedupe_window_ns`, and `profile_id` are
valid only with `cf_name="AUDIT_RETENTION"`. The response then includes
`audit_retention_report_key` and an `audit_retention` report with before/after
row counts, per-CF scanned/deleted/backfilled/unknown-schema counts,
`dedupe_keys`, and the readback report state that was actually persisted to
`CF_KV`.

### 3.34 `storage_pressure_sample`

Applies one synthetic free-byte sample through the production disk-pressure
responder. Manual FSV must separately read `storage_inspect` and logs after each
sample to confirm the pressure level and emitted transition code.

```json
{
  "name": "storage_pressure_sample",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": ["free_bytes"],
    "properties": {"free_bytes": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0}}
  }
}
```

## 4. Errors

All errors follow JSON-RPC `error` shape:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": <request_id>,
  "error": {
    "code": -32099,
    "message": "Human-readable summary",
    "data": {
      "code": "ACTION_QUEUE_FULL",
      "tool": "act_click",
      "details": {"queue_depth": 256, "limit": 256},
      "retry_after_ms": 50
    }
  }
}
```

`code: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` in `data.code` is the stable identifier; numeric JSON-RPC `code` is always `-32099` (server-defined error) or `-32602` (invalid params).

Full error code catalog in `06_data_schemas.md` §Error codes.

## 5. M4/M5 Default Resolution Rows

The `tools/list` schema must expose the JSON defaults below once these M4 tools
land and for M5 tools whose safety behavior depends on caller-visible defaults.
Rows that say "required", "omitted", or "inherits" define runtime resolution
behavior rather than a JSON-Schema `default` value. Issue #448 owns the M4
default-resolution readback; current `tools/list` snapshots also pin the M5
profile-authoring and audit-export defaults below.

| Tool | Field | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `act_keymap` | `alias` | required; no default | #499 |
| `act_keymap` | `hold_ms` | `33` | M2 action default reused by #499 |
| `act_keymap` | `backend` | `"auto"` | M2 action default reused by #499 |
| `act_combo` | `steps` | required; no default | M4 plan #444 |
| `act_combo` | `steps[].backend` | inherits top-level `backend` | M4 plan #444 |

All listed schemas must serialize as closed top-level JSON objects with
`additionalProperties: false`. `act_combo.steps[]` also serializes as a closed
object. The nested `act_combo.steps[].params` object is validated against the
selected action tool schema before scheduling; it is not accepted as unchecked
free-form input.

## 6. Transports

| Transport | When | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| stdio | Local agent client (Claude Desktop, Codex CLI) | Tool calls + push notifications via the same stream |
| Streamable HTTP | Remote / multi-agent | Tool calls (POST JSON), push events (SSE upgrade on GET), session via `Mcp-Session-Id` header |

Server binary selects via `--mode {stdio|http}`. `--bind 127.0.0.1:7700` for HTTP; default bind is localhost-only.

For long-running tools (`describe` with VLM inference, `audio_transcribe`), server upgrades to SSE and emits progress notifications:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/progress","params":{"progressToken":"...","progress":50,"total":100,"message":"Inference 50% done"}}
```

Final response arrives as a normal JSON-RPC reply when complete.

---

## 7. Session model

`initialize` creates a session. Server returns `Mcp-Session-Id` (HTTP) or implicitly tracks the stdio process. Per-session state:

- Active capture target
- Active perception mode
- Active profile
- Open subscriptions
- Registered reflexes
- Allowed back-ends (`vigem`, `hardware`)
- Allow-listed shell patterns

Closing the session (or process exit) cancels all subscriptions and reflexes, releases all held inputs (via `release_all`), and persists session metadata to `CF_SESSIONS`.

`delete` request to the MCP endpoint with session id explicitly tears down the session.

---

## 8. Push event format

On subscription fire, server emits one notification/SSE frame per event:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "synapse/event",
  "params": {
    "subscription_id": "...",
    "stream_seq": 1,
    "lossy": false,
    "event": {
      "seq": 123456,
      "at": "2026-05-22T15:00:00Z",
      "source": "perception.detection",
      "kind": "entity_appeared",
      "data": {"track_id": 42, "class_label": "enemy", "bbox": {"x":820,"y":340,"w":60,"h":130}, "confidence": 0.87}
    }
  }
}
```

Agent's MCP client must implement notification handling (most do natively).
`stream_seq` is the per-subscription SSE resume sequence. `event.seq` remains
the domain event sequence.

For resumability over HTTP, each SSE event carries `id: <stream_seq>`. On
reconnect, client sends `Last-Event-ID: <stream_seq>` and server replays
buffered events from there. Buffer depth: 4096 events per subscription. If a
gap or overflow is detected, Synapse sends a `subscription_started` frame with
`lossy: true` before continuing event delivery.

## 9. Tool examples (end-to-end)

### Example A — open Notepad, type a paragraph, save

```
→ profile_activate(profile_id="notepad")
→ act_launch(target="notepad.exe", wait_for_window_title_regex="Untitled")
← {pid:..., hwnd:...}
→ observe(include=["focused","elements"])
← Observation with the editor element_id
→ act_type(into_element="<editor_element_id>", text="Hello world.\nThis is Synapse.")
→ act_press(keys=["ctrl","s"])
→ observe(include=["focused","elements"])           # waits implicitly until UIA settles
← Observation with the Save As dialog visible
→ find(query="filename edit field", scope=elements, limit=1)
← {results: [{element_id: "...", role: "Edit"}]}
→ act_type(into_element="<filename_edit_id>", text="C:\\tmp\\demo.txt", press_enter_after=true)
```

8 tool calls, ~2 KB token cost end-to-end.

### Example B — track and shoot in a game

```
→ profile_activate(profile_id="some_fps_singleplayer")
→ observe(include=["entities","hud"])
← entities: [{entity_id: "track:42", class_label: "enemy", ...}]
→ act_aim(target={track_id:42}, style="track")
← {reflex_id: "<r1>"}
→ reflex_register(
    kind="on_event",
    params={
      when:{kind:"detection",match:{track_id:42,inside_crosshair:true}},
      then:{action:"act_press", args:{keys:["lmb"], hold_ms:50}},
      debounce_ms:200
    },
    lifetime={UntilEvent:{kind:"entity_disappeared",track_id:42}}
)
← {reflex_id: "<r2>"}
(... agent waits, reflex runtime handles per-frame ...)
→ subscribe(filter={kind:"entity_disappeared",track_id:42})
← {subscription_id: "..."}
... entity_disappeared notification arrives ...
→ reflex_cancel(reflex_id="<r1>")
```

5 tool calls + 1 push event = under 1 KB tokens, with frame-accurate execution between calls.
