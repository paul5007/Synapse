# Synapse Systemspec

Comprehensive technical reference for the Synapse MCP server, produced by reading the source. Every claim in these documents is derived from `crates/` source files cited inline; no aspirational behavior is documented.

## Authority

- `AGENTS.md` and `docs/impplan/00_methodology.md` are the operating doctrine.
  Manual FSV is the shipping gate; this systemspec is descriptive only.
  Missing configured-host prerequisites are acquisition/setup work: agents use
  Synapse/local control as the operator-equivalent host control surface with
  full local computer-control responsibility to make reversible local
  prerequisites real, then read the physical source of truth.
  Do not stop at "missing"; Synapse gives the agent the same practical local
  ability the operator has at this keyboard, so if the operator could do it
  from this computer, the agent must do it through Synapse/local host workflows
  and inspect the SoT.
  Missing local state creates the next action for the agent and must be made
  real, not handed back to the operator or treated as a blocker while
  reversible host work remains.
  Nothing is ever `status:blocked` because a configured-host prerequisite is
  absent; the only blockable item is the exact operator-only hard-to-reverse
  external action left after every reversible local step is exhausted.
  Browser downloads, GUI installers, Device Manager checks, package-manager
  installs, model/file generation, firmware flashing, app launching, USB/COM
  inspection, and UI inspection are agent-owned work when reversible on this
  host.
