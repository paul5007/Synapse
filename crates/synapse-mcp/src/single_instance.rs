//! Single-instance guard for the Synapse daemon (`--mode http`).
//!
//! Guarantees that at most one daemon process owns a given RocksDB directory at
//! a time. The guard is acquired at startup **before** RocksDB is opened, so a
//! duplicate launch fails fast with a clear, actionable error that names the
//! current holder PID — instead of surfacing later as a cryptic RocksDB `LOCK`
//! failure deep inside a tool call (the exact symptom that motivated this work).
//!
//! Mechanism: an OS advisory exclusive file lock (`fs2`) on `<db>/daemon.lock`.
//! Chosen over a bare Win32 named mutex because the lock is released
//! automatically by the OS when the holding process dies, so a crashed daemon
//! never wedges future launches, and because it is cross-platform (so the
//! behavior is testable off-Windows).
//!
//! The holder PID is deliberately stored in a **separate** `<db>/daemon.pid`
//! file rather than inside the lock file. On Windows `fs2` uses `LockFileEx`,
//! whose exclusive lock is a *mandatory whole-file* lock: while held, no other
//! process can even read the locked file. Storing the PID in an unlocked
//! sidecar keeps it readable by duplicate launchers and by
//! `synapse-mcp doctor`, while the lock file itself stays empty.
