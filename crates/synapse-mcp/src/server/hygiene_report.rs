//! `hygiene_report` MCP tool (#874).
//!
//! Closes the "flags point at raw rows, but is my *learned state* poisoned?"
//! gap. The injection scanner (#872) writes flag rows that link back to a
//! physical `CF_TIMELINE`/`CF_OBSERVATIONS` source row. This tool joins those
//! flags forward through the real derivation chain — `CF_TIMELINE` →
//! `CF_EPISODES` → `CF_ROUTINES` → profile-authoring candidates — so an agent
//! (or the human via the dashboard) can see exactly which episodes, mined
//! routines, and installable/reviewable candidates were derived from flagged
//! content, and judge whether learned state was poisoned.
//!
//! It lives in its own tool router (merged in `server.rs`) rather than the M3
//! dispatch table, so the read-only report surface stays decoupled from the
//! scanner/cleaner write tools. The join logic and types are owned by
//! [`crate::m3::hygiene`]; this module is the thin MCP wrapper: log, enforce
//! `ReadStorage`, run.

Links flags → physical source rows → derived artifacts so a caller can tell whether learned state was poisoned, not just which raw rows are flagged. Paged (limit/cursor), filterable (source_cf/source_key_hex/min_score/time_range), and honest-empty when clean. Returns scanned_flag/episode/routine/authoring_candidate row counts so the derivation is verifiably non-truncated."
